<head>GREAT EXPECTATIONS.</head>
<div2 type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<p>THE journey from our town to the metropolis, was a journey of about five hours. It was a little past mid-day when the four-horse stage-coach by which I was a passenger, got into the ravel of traffic frayed out about the Cross-Keys, Wood-street, Cheapside, London.</p>
<p>We Britons had at that time particularly settled that it was treasonable to doubt our having and our being the best of everything: otherwise, while I was scared by the immensity of London, I think I might have
<pb n="2" id="p2b"/>
had some faint doubts whether it was not rather ugly, crooked, narrow, and dirty.</p>
<p>Mr. Jaggers had duly sent me his address; it was, Little Britain, and he had written after it on his card, &ldquo;just out of Smithfield, and close by the coach-office.&rdquo; Nevertheless, a hackney-coachman, who seemed to have as many capes to his greasy great-coat as he was years old, packed me up in his coach and hemmed me in with a folding and jingling barrier of steps, as if he were going to take me fifty miles. His getting on his box, which I remember to have been decorated with an old weather-stained pea-green hammercloth motheaten into rags, was quite a work of time. It was a wonderful equipage, with six great coronets outside, and ragged things behind for I don't know how many footmen to hold on by, and a harrow below them, to prevent amateur footmen from yielding to the temptation.</p>
<p>I had scarcely had time to enjoy the coach and to think how like a straw-yard it was, and yet how like a rag-shop, and to wonder why the horses' nose-bags were kept inside, when I observed the coachman beginning to
<pb n="3" id="p3b"/>
get down, as if we were going to stop presently. And stop we presently did, in a gloomy street, at certain offices with an open door, whereon was painted MR. JAGGERS.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much?&rdquo; I asked the coachman.</p>
<p>The coachman answered, &ldquo;A shilling&mdash;unless you wish to make it more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I naturally said I had no wish to make it more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it must be a shilling,&rdquo; observed the coachman. &ldquo;I don't want to get into trouble. <hi rend="italics">I</hi> know <hi rend="italics">him!</hi>&rdquo; He darkly closed an eye at Mr. Jaggers's name, and shook his head.</p>
<p>When he had got his shilling, and had in course of time completed the ascent to his box, and had got away (which appeared to relieve his mind), I went into the front office with my little portmanteau in my hand and asked, Was Mr. Jaggers at home?</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not,&rdquo; returned the clerk. &ldquo;He is in Court at present. Am I addressing Mr. Pip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I signified that he was addressing Mr. Pip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Jaggers left word would you wait
<pb n="4" id="p4b"/>
in his room. He couldn't say how long he might be, having a case on. But it stands to reason, his time being valuable, that he won't be longer than he can help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With those words, the clerk opened a door, and ushered me into an inner chamber at the back. Here, we found a gentleman with one eye, in a velveteen suit and knee-breeches, who wiped his nose with his sleeve on being interrupted in the perusal of the newspaper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and wait outside, Mike,&rdquo; said the clerk.</p>
<p>I began to say that I hoped I was not interrupting&mdash;when the clerk shoved this gentleman out with as little ceremony as I ever saw used, and tossing his fur cap out after him, left me alone.</p>
<p>Mr. Jaggers's room was lighted by a skylight only, and was a most dismal place; the skylight, eccentrically patched like a broken head, and the distorted adjoining houses looking as if they had twisted themselves to peep down at me through it. There were not so many papers about, as I should have expected to see; and there were some odd
<pb n="5" id="p5b"/>
objects about, that I should not have expected to see&mdash;such as an old rusty pistol, a sword in a scabbard, several strange-looking boxes and packages, and two dreadful casts on a shelf, of faces peculiarly swollen, and twitchy about the nose. Mr. Jaggers's own high-backed chair was of deadly black horse-hair, with rows of brass nails round it, like a coffin; and I fancied I could see how he leaned back in it, and bit his forefinger at the clients. The room was but small, and the clients seemed to have had a habit of backing up against the wall: the wall, especially opposite to Mr. Jaggers's chair, being greasy with shoulders. I recalled, too, that the one-eyed gentleman had shuffled forth against the wall when I was the innocent cause of his being turned out.</p>
<p>I sat down in the cliental chair placed over against Mr. Jaggers's chair, and became fascinated by the dismal atmosphere of the place. I called to mind that the clerk had the same air of knowing something to everybody else's disadvantage, as his master had. I wondered how many other clerks there were up-stairs, and whether they all claimed
<pb n="6" id="p6b"/>
to have the same detrimental mastery of their fellow-creatures. I wondered what was the history of all the odd litter about the room, and how it came there. I wondered whether the two swollen faces were of Mr. Jaggers's family, and, if he were so unfortunate as to have had a pair of such ill-looking relations, why he stuck them on that dusty perch for the blacks and flies to settle on, instead of giving them a place at home. Of course I had no experience of a London summer day, and my spirits may have been oppressed by the hot exhausted air, and by the dust and grit that lay thick on everything. But I sat wondering and waiting in Mr. Jaggers's close room, until I really could not bear the two casts on the shelf above Mr. Jaggers's chair, and got up and went out.</p>
<p>When I told the clerk that I would take a turn in the air while I waited, he advised me to go round the corner and I should come into Smithfield. So, I came into Smithfield; and the shameful place, being all asmear with filth and fat and blood and foam, seemed to stick to me. So, I rubbed
<pb n="7" id="p7b"/>
it off with all possible speed by turning into a street where I saw the great black dome of Saint Paul's bulging at me from behind a grim stone building which a bystander said was Newgate Prison. Following the wall of the jail, I found the roadway covered with straw to deaden the noise of passing vehicles; and from this, and from the quantity of people standing about, smelling strongly of spirits and beer, I inferred that the trials were on.</p>
<p>While I looked about me here, an exceedingly dirty and partially drunk minister of justice asked me if I would like to step in and hear a trial or so: informing me that he could give me a front place for half-a-crown, whence I should command a full view of the Lord Chief Justice in his wig and robes&mdash;mentioning that awful personage like waxwork, and presently offering him at the reduced price of eighteenpence. As I declined the proposal on the plea of an appointment, he was so good as to take me into a yard and show me where the gallows was kept, and also where people were publicly whipped, and then he showed me
<pb n="8" id="p8b"/>
the Debtors' Door, out of which culprits came to be hanged: heightening the interest of that dreadful portal by giving me to understand that &ldquo;four on 'em&rdquo; would come out at that door the day after to-morrow at eight in the morning, to be killed in a row. This was horrible, and gave me a sickening idea of London: the more so as the Lord Chief Justice's proprietor wore (from his hat down to his boots and up again to his pocket-handkerchief inclusive) mildewed clothes, which had evidently not belonged to him originally, and which, I took it into my head, he had bought cheap of the executioner. Under these circumstances I thought myself well rid of him for a shilling.</p>
<p>I dropped into the office to ask if Mr. Jaggers had come in yet, and I found he had not, and I strolled out again. This time, I made the tour of Little Britain, and turned into Bartholomew Close; and now I became aware that other people were waiting about for Mr. Jaggers, as well as I. There were two men of secret appearance lounging in Bartholomew Close, and thoughtfully fitting their feet into the cracks of the
<pb n="9" id="p9b"/>
pavement as they talked together, one of whom said to the other when they first passed me, that &ldquo;Jaggers would do it if it was to be done.&rdquo; There was a knot of three men and two women standing at a corner, and one of the women was crying on her dirty shawl, and the other comforted her by saying, as she pulled her own shawl over her shoulders, &ldquo;Jaggers is for him, 'Melia, and what more <hi rend="italics">could</hi> you have?&rdquo; There was a red-eyed little Jew who came into the Close while I was loitering there, in company with a second little Jew whom he sent upon an errand; and while the messenger was gone, I remarked this Jew, who was of a highly excitable temperament, performing a jig of anxiety under a lamp-post, and accompanying himself, in a kind of frenzy, with the words, &ldquo;Oh Jaggerth, Jaggerth, Jaggerth! all otherth ith Cag-Maggerth, give me Jaggerth!&rdquo; These testimonies to the popularity of my guardian made a deep impression on me, and I admired and wondered more than ever.</p>
<p>At length, as I was looking out at the iron gate of Bartholomew Close into Little
<pb n="10" id="p10b"/>
Britain, I saw Mr. Jaggers coming across the road towards me. All the others who were waiting, saw him at the same time, and there was quite a rush at him. Mr. Jaggers, putting a hand on my shoulder and walking me on at his side without saying anything to me, addressed himself to his followers.</p>
<p>First, he took the two secret men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I have nothing to say to <hi rend="italics">you,</hi>&rdquo; said Mr. Jaggers, throwing his finger at them. &ldquo;I want to know no more than I know. As to the result, it's a toss-up. I told you from the first it was a toss-up. Have you paid Wemmick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We made the money up this morning, sir,&rdquo; said one of the men, submissively, while the other perused Mr. Jaggers's face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't ask you when you made it up, or where, or whether you made it up at all. Has Wemmick got it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said both the men together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well; then you may go. Now, I won't have it!&rdquo; said Mr. Jaggers, waving his hand at them to put them behind him. &ldquo;If you say a word to me, I'll throw up the case.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="11" id="p11b"/>
<p>&ldquo;We thought, Mr. Jaggers&mdash;&rdquo; one of the men began, pulling off his hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's what I told you not to do,&rdquo; said Mr. Jaggers. &ldquo;<hi rend="italics">You</hi> thought! I think for you; that's enough for you. If I want you, I know where to find you; I don't want you to find me. Now I won't have it. I won't hear a word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men looked at one another as Mr. Jaggers waved them behind again, and humbly fell back and were heard no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now <hi rend="italics">you!</hi>&rdquo; said Mr. Jaggers, suddenly stopping, and turning on the two women with the shawls, from whom the three men had meekly separated.&mdash;&ldquo;Oh! Amelia, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Jaggers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you remember,&rdquo; retorted Mr. Jaggers, &ldquo;that but for me you wouldn't be here and couldn't be here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, sir!&rdquo; exclaimed both women together. &ldquo;Lord bless you, sir, well we knows that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why,&rdquo; said Mr. Jaggers, &ldquo;do you come here?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="12" id="p12b"/>
<p>&ldquo;My Bill, sir!&rdquo; the crying woman pleaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I tell you what!&rdquo; said Mr. Jaggers. &ldquo;Once for all. If you don't know that your Bill's in good hands, I know it. And if you come here, bothering about your Bill, I'll make an example of both your Bill and you, and let him slip through my fingers. Have you paid Wemmick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, sir! Every farden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well. Then you have done all you have got to do. Say another word&mdash;one single word&mdash;and Wemmick shall give you your money back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This terrible threat caused the two women to fall off immediately. No one remained now but the excitable Jew, who had already raised the skirts of Mr. Jaggers's coat to his lips several times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't know this man!&rdquo; said Mr. Jaggers, in the same devastating strain. &ldquo;What does this fellow want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ma thear Mithter Jaggerth. Hown brother to Habraham Latharuth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who's he?&rdquo; said Mr. Jaggers. &ldquo;Let go of my coat.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="13" id="p13b"/>
<p>The suitor, kissing the hem of the garment again before relinquishing it, replied, &ldquo;Habraham Latharuth, on thuthpithion of plate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You're too late,&rdquo; said Mr. Jaggers. &ldquo;I am over the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holy father, Mithter Jaggerth!&rdquo; cried my excitable acquaintance, turning white, &ldquo;don't thay you're again Habraham Latharuth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said Mr. Jaggers, &ldquo;and there's an end of it. Get out of the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mithter Jaggerth! Half a moment! My hown cuthen'th gone to Mithter Wemmick at thith prethent minute, to hoffer him hany termth. Mithter Jaggerth! Half a quarter of a moment! If you'd have the condethenthun to be bought off from the t'other thide&mdash;at hany thuperior prithe!&mdash;money no object!&mdash;Mithter Jaggerth&mdash;Mithter&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>My guardian threw his supplicant off with supreme indifference, and left him dancing on the pavement as if it were red-hot. Without further interruption, we reached the front office, where we found the clerk
<pb n="14" id="p14b"/>
and the man in velveteen with the fur cap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here's Mike,&rdquo; said the clerk, getting down from his stool, and approaching Mr. Jaggers confidentially.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Mr. Jaggers, turning to the man, who was pulling a lock of hair in the middle of his forehead, like the Bull in Cock Robin pulling at the bell-rope; &ldquo;your man comes on this afternoon. Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mas'r Jaggers,&rdquo; returned Mike, in the voice of a sufferer from a constitutional cold; &ldquo;arter a deal o' trouble, I've found one, sir, as might do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is he prepared to swear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mas'r Jaggers,&rdquo; said Mike, wiping his nose on his fur cap this time; &ldquo;in a general way, anythink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Jaggers suddenly became most irate. &ldquo;Now, I warned you before,&rdquo; said he, throwing his forefinger at the terrified client, &ldquo;that if you ever presumed to talk in that way here, I'd make an example of you. You infernal scoundrel, how dare you tell ME that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The client looked scared, but bewildered
<pb n="15" id="p15b"/>
too, as if he were unconscious what he had done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spooney!&rdquo; said the clerk, in a low voice, giving him a stir with his elbow. &ldquo;Soft Head! Need you say it face to face?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I ask you, you blundering booby,&rdquo; said my guardian, very sternly, &ldquo;once more and for the last time, what the man you have brought here is prepared to swear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mike looked hard at my guardian, as if he were trying to learn a lesson from his face, and slowly replied, &ldquo;Ayther to character, or to having been in his company and never left him all the night in question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, be careful. In what station of life is this man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mike looked at his cap, and looked at the floor, and looked at the ceiling, and looked at the clerk, and even looked at me, before beginning to reply in a nervous manner, &ldquo;We've dressed him up like&mdash;&rdquo; when my guardian blustered out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? You WILL, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>(&ldquo;Spooney!&rdquo; added the clerk again, with another stir.)</p>
<pb n="16" id="p16b"/>
<p>After some helpless casting about, Mike brightened and began again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is dressed like a 'spectable pieman. A sort of a pastrycook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he here?&rdquo; asked my guardian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I left him,&rdquo; said Mike, &ldquo;a settin on some door-steps round the corner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take him past that window, and let me see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The window indicated, was the office window. We all three went to it, behind the wire blind, and presently saw the client go by in an accidental manner, with a murderous-looking tall individual, in a short suit of white linen and a paper cap. This guileless confectioner was not by any means sober, and had a black eye in the green stage of recovery, which was painted over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him to take his witness away directly,&rdquo; said my guardian to the clerk, in extreme disgust, &ldquo;and ask him what he means by bringing such a fellow as that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My guardian then took me into his own room, and while he lunched, standing, from a sandwich-box and a pocket-flask of sherry (he seemed to bully his very sandwich as he
<pb n="17" id="p17b"/>
ate it), informed me what arrangements he had made for me. I was to go to &ldquo;Barnard's Inn,&rdquo; to young Mr. Pocket's rooms, where a bed had been sent in for my accommodation; I was to remain with young Mr. Pocket until Monday; on Monday I was to go with him to his father's house on a visit, that I might try how I liked it. Also, I was told what my allowance was to be&mdash;it was a very liberal one&mdash;and had handed to me from one of my guardian's drawers, the cards of certain tradesmen with whom I was to deal for all kinds of clothes, and such other things as I could in reason want. &ldquo;You will find your credit good, Mr. Pip,&rdquo; said my guardian, whose flask of sherry smelt like a whole cask-full, as he hastily refreshed himself, &ldquo;but I shall by this means be able to check your bills, and to pull you up if I find you outrunning the constable. Of course you'll go wrong somehow, but that's no fault of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After I had pondered a little over this encouraging sentiment, I asked Mr. Jaggers if I could send for a coach? He said it was
<pb n="18" id="p18b"/>
not worth while, I was so near my destination; Wemmick should walk round with me, if I pleased.</p>
<p>I then found that Wemmick was the clerk in the next room. Another clerk was rung down from up-stairs to take his place while he was out, and I accompanied him into the street, after shaking hands with my guardian. We found a new set of people lingering outside, but Wemmick made a way among them by saying coolly yet decisively, &ldquo;I tell you it's no use; he won't have a word to say to one of you;&rdquo; and we soon got clear of them, and went on side by side.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter">
<pb n="19" id="p19b"/>
<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<p>CASTING my eyes on Mr. Wemmick as we went along, to see what he was like in the light of day, I found him to be a dry man, rather short in stature, with a square wooden face, whose expression seemed to have been imperfectly chipped out with a dull-edged chisel. There were some marks in it that might have been dimples, if the material had been softer and the instrument finer, but which, as it was, were only dints. The chisel had made three or four of these attempts at embellishment over his nose, but had given them up without an effort to smooth them off. I judged him to be a bachelor from the frayed condition of his
<pb n="20" id="p20b"/>
linen, and he appeared to have sustained a good many bereavements; for, he wore at least four mourning rings, besides a brooch representing a lady and a weeping willow at a tomb with an urn on it. I noticed, too, that several rings and seals hung at his watch-chain, as if he were quite laden with remembrances of departed friends. He had glittering eyes&mdash;small, keen, and black&mdash;and thin wide mottled lips. He had had them, to the best of my belief, from forty to fifty years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you were never in London before?&rdquo; said Mr. Wemmick to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italics">I</hi> was new here once,&rdquo; said Mr. Wemmick. &ldquo;Rum to think of now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are well acquainted with it now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Wemmick. &ldquo;I know the moves of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it a very wicked place?&rdquo; I asked, more for the sake of saying something than for information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may get cheated, robbed, and murdered, in London. But there are plenty of people anywhere, who'll do that for you.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="21" id="p21b"/>
<p>&ldquo;If there is bad blood between you and them,&rdquo; said I, to soften it off a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I don't know about bad blood,&rdquo; returned Mr. Wemmick; &ldquo;there's not much bad blood about. They'll do it, if there's anything to be got by it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That makes it worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think so?&rdquo; returned Mr. Wemmick. &ldquo;Much about the same, I should say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wore his hat on the back of his head, and looked straight before him: walking in a self-contained way as if there were nothing in the streets to claim his attention. His mouth was such a post-office of a mouth that he had a mechanical appearance of smiling. We had got to the top of Holborn Hill before I knew that it was merely a mechanical appearance, and that he was not smiling at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know where Mr. Matthew Pocket lives?&rdquo; I asked Mr. Wemmick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, nodding in the direction. &ldquo;At Hammersmith, west of London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that far?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! Say five miles.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="22" id="p22b"/>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you're a regular cross-examiner!&rdquo; said Mr. Wemmick, looking at me with an approving air. &ldquo;Yes, I know him. <hi rend="italics">I</hi> know him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was an air of toleration or depreciation about his utterance of these words, that rather depressed me; and I was still looking sideways at his block of a face in search of any encouraging note to the text, when he said here we were at Barnard's Inn. My depression was not alleviated by the announcement, for, I had supposed that establishment to be an hotel kept by Mr. Barnard, to which the Blue Boar in our town was a mere public-house. Whereas I now found Barnard to be a disembodied spirit, or a fiction, and his inn the dingiest collection of shabby buildings ever squeezed together in a rank corner as a club for Tomcats.</p>
<p>We entered this haven through a wicket-gate, and were disgorged by an introductory passage into a melancholy little square that looked to me like a flat burying-ground. I thought it had the most dismal trees in it,
<pb n="23" id="p23b"/>
and the most dismal sparrows, and the most dismal cats, and the most dismal houses (in number half a dozen or so), that I had ever seen. I thought the windows of the sets of chambers into which these houses were divided, were in every stage of dilapidated blind and curtain, crippled flower-pot, cracked glass, dusty decay, and miserable makeshift; while To Let To Let To Let, glared at me from empty rooms, as if no new wretches ever came there, and the vengeance of the soul of Barnard were being slowly appeased by the gradual suicide of the present occupants and their unholy interment under the gravel. A frouzy mourning of soot and smoke attired this forlorn creation of Barnard, and it had strewn ashes on its head, and was undergoing penance and humiliation as a mere dust-hole. Thus far my sense of sight; while dry rot and wet rot and all the silent rots that rot in neglected roof and cellar&mdash;rot of rat and mouse and bug and coaching-stables near at hand besides&mdash;addressed themselves faintly to my sense of smell, and moaned, &ldquo;Try Barnard's Mixture.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="24" id="p24b"/>
<p>So imperfect was this realisation of the first of my great expectations, that I looked in dismay at Mr. Wemmick. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said he, mistaking me; &ldquo;the retirement reminds you of the country. So it does me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He led me into a corner and conducted me up a flight of stairs&mdash;which appeared to me to be slowly collapsing into sawdust, so that one of those days the upper lodgers would look out at their doors and find themselves without the means of coming down&mdash;to a set of chambers on the top floor. MR. POCKET, JUN., was painted on the door, and there was a label on the letter-box, &ldquo;Return shortly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hardly thought you'd come so soon,&rdquo; Mr. Wemmick explained. &ldquo;You don't want me any more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I keep the cash,&rdquo; Mr. Wemmick observed, &ldquo;we shall most likely meet pretty often. Good day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I put out my hand, and Mr. Wemmick at first looked at it as if he thought I
<pb n="25" id="p25b"/>
wanted something. Then he looked at me, and said, correcting himself,</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure! Yes. You're in the habit of shaking hands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was rather confused, thinking it must be out of the London fashion, but said yes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have got so out of it!&rdquo; said Mr. Wemmick&mdash;&ldquo;except at last. Very glad, I'm sure, to make your acquaintance. Good day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When we had shaken hands and he was gone, I opened the staircase window and had nearly beheaded myself, for, the lines had rotted away, and it came down like the guillotine. Happily it was so quick that I had not put my head out. After this escape, I was content to take a foggy view of the Inn through the window's encrusting dirt, and to stand dolefully looking out, saying to myself that London was decidedly overrated.</p>
<p>Mr. Pocket, Junior's, idea of Shortly was not mine, for I had nearly maddened myself with looking out for half an hour, and had written my name with my finger several times in the dirt of every pane in the window,
<pb n="26" id="p26b"/>
before I heard footsteps on the stairs. Gradually there arose before me the hat, head, neckcloth, waistcoat, trousers, boots, of a member of society of about my own standing. He had a paper-bag under each arm and a pottle of strawberries in one hand, and was out of breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Pip?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Pocket?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I am extremely sorry; but I knew there was a coach from your part of the country at midday, and I thought you would come by that one. The fact is, I have been out on your account&mdash;not that that is any excuse&mdash;for I thought, coming from the country, you might like a little fruit after dinner, and I went to Covent Garden Market to get it good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a reason that I had, I felt as if my eyes would start out of my head. I acknowledged his attention incoherently, and began to think this was a dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said Mr. Pocket, Junior. &ldquo;This door sticks so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he was fast making jam of his fruit by
<pb n="27" id="p27b"/>
wrestling with the door while the paper-bags were under his arms, I begged him to allow me to hold them. He relinquished them with an agreeable smile, and combated with the door as if it were a wild beast. It yielded so suddenly at last, that he staggered back upon me, and I staggered back upon the opposite door, and we both laughed. But still I felt as if my eyes must start out of my head, and as if this must be a dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray come in,&rdquo; said Mr. Pocket, Junior. &ldquo;Allow me to lead the way. I am rather bare here, but I hope you'll be able to make out tolerably well till Monday. My father thought you would get on more agreeably through to-morrow with me than with him, and might like to take a walk about London. I am sure I shall be very happy to show London to you. As to our table, you won't find that bad, I hope, for it will be supplied from our coffee-house here, and (it is only right I should add) at your expense, such being Mr. Jaggers's directions. As to our lodging, it's not by any means splendid, because I have my own bread to earn, and my father hasn't anything to give me, and
<pb n="28" id="p28b"/>
I shouldn't be willing to take it, if he had. This is our sitting-room&mdash;just such chairs and tables and carpet and so forth, you see, as they could spare from home. You mustn't give me credit for the tablecloth and spoons and castors, because they come for you from the coffee-house. This is my little bedroom; rather musty, but Barnard's <hi rend="italics">is</hi> musty. This is your bedroom; the furniture's hired for the occasion, but I trust it will answer the purpose; if you should want anything, I'll go and fetch it. The chambers are retired, and we shall be alone together, but we shan't fight, I dare say. But, dear me, I beg your pardon, you're holding the fruit all this time. Pray let me take these bags from you. I am quite ashamed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I stood opposite to Mr. Pocket, Junior, delivering him the bags, One, Two, I saw the starting appearance come into his own eyes that I knew to be in mine, and he said, falling back:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord bless me, you're the prowling boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;are the pale young gentleman!&rdquo;</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter">
<pb n="29" id="p29b"/>
<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<p>THE pale young gentleman and I stood contemplating one another in Barnard's Inn, until we both burst out laughing. &ldquo;The idea of its being you!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The idea of its being <hi rend="italics">you!</hi>&rdquo; said I. And then we contemplated one another afresh, and laughed again. &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said the pale young gentleman, reaching out his hand good humouredly, &ldquo;it's all over now, I hope, and it will be magnanimous in you if you'll forgive me for having knocked you about so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I derived from this speech that Mr. Herbert Pocket (for Herbert was the pale young gentleman's name) still rather confounded his intention with his execution. But I
<pb n="30" id="p30b"/>
made a modest reply, and we shook hands warmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hadn't come into your good fortune at that time?&rdquo; said Herbert Pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he acquiesced: &ldquo;I heard it had happened very lately. <hi rend="italics">I</hi> was rather on the look-out for good fortune then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Miss Havisham had sent for me, to see if she could take a fancy to me. But she couldn't&mdash;at all events, she didn't.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought it polite to remark that I was surprised to hear that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad taste,&rdquo; said Herbert, laughing, &ldquo;but a fact. Yes, she had sent for me on a trial visit, and if I had come out of it successfully, I suppose I should have been provided for; perhaps I should have been what-you-may-called it to Estella.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; I asked, with sudden gravity.</p>
<p>He was arranging his fruit in plates while we talked, which divided his attention, and was the cause of his having made this lapse of a word. &ldquo;Affianced,&rdquo; he explained, still
<pb n="31" id="p31b"/>
busy with the fruit. &ldquo;Betrothed. Engaged. What's-his-named. Any word of that sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you bear your disappointment?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I didn't care much for it. <hi rend="italics">She's</hi> a Tartar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Havisham?&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't say no to that, but I meant Estella. That girl's hard and haughty and capricious to the last degree, and has been brought up by Miss Havisham to wreak revenge on all the male sex.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What relation is she to Miss Havisham?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Only adopted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should she wreak revenge on all the male sex? What revenge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, Mr. Pip!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Don't you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me! It's quite a story, and shall be saved till dinner-time. And now let me take the liberty of asking you a question. How did you come there, that day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told him, and he was attentive until I had finished, and then burst out laughing
<pb n="32" id="p32b"/>
again, and asked me if I was sore afterwards? I didn't ask him if <hi rend="italics">he</hi> was, for my conviction on that point was perfectly established.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Jaggers is your guardian, I understand?&rdquo; he went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know he is Miss Havisham's man of business and solicitor, and has her confidence when nobody else has?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was bringing me (I felt) towards dangerous ground. I answered with a constraint I made no attempt to disguise, that I had seen Mr. Jaggers in Miss Havisham's house on the very day of our combat, but never at any other time, and that I believed he had no recollection of having ever seen me there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was so obliging as to suggest my father for your tutor, and he called on my father to propose it. Of course he knew about my father from his connexion with Miss Havisham. My father is Miss Havisham's cousin; not that that implies familiar intercourse between them, for he is a bad courtier and will not propitiate her.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="33" id="p33b"/>
<p>Herbert Pocket had a frank and easy way with him that was very taking. I had never seen any one then, and I have never seen any one since, who more strongly expressed to me, in every look and tone, a natural incapacity to do anything secret and mean. There was something wonderfully hopeful about his general air, and something that at the same time whispered to me he would never be very successful or rich. I don't know how this was. I became imbued with the notion on that first occasion before we sat down to dinner, but I cannot define by what means.</p>
<p>He was still a pale young gentleman, and had a certain conquered languor about him in the midst of his spirits and briskness, that did not seem indicative of natural strength. He had not a handsome face, but it was better than handsome: being extremely amiable and cheerful. His figure was a little ungainly, as in the days when my knuckles had taken such liberties with it, but it looked as if it would always be light and young. Whether Mr. Trabb's local work would have sat more gracefully on
<pb n="34" id="p34b"/>
him than on me, may be a question; but I am conscious that he carried off his rather old clothes, much better than I carried off my new suit.</p>
<p>As he was so communicative, I felt that reserve on my part would be a bad return unsuited to our years. I therefore told him my small story, and laid stress on my being forbidden to inquire who my benefactor was. I further mentioned that as I had been brought up a blacksmith in a country place, and knew very little of the ways of politeness, I would take it as a great kindness in him if he would give me a hint whenever he saw me at a loss or going wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With pleasure,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;though I venture to prophesy that you'll want very few hints. I dare say we shall be often together, and I should like to banish any needless restraint between us. Will you do me the favour to begin at once to call me by my christian name, Herbert?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thanked him, and said I would. I informed him in exchange that my christian name was Philip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't take to Philip,&rdquo; said he, smiling,
<pb n="35" id="p35b"/>
&ldquo;for it sounds like a moral boy out of the spelling-book, who was so lazy that he fell into a pond, or so fat that he couldn't see out of his eyes, or so avaricious that he locked up his cake till the mice ate it, or so determined to go a birds'-nesting that he got himself eaten by bears who lived handy in the neighbourhood. I tell you what I should like. We are so harmonious, and you have been a blacksmith&mdash;would you mind it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn't mind anything that you propose,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;but I don't understand you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you mind Handel for a familiar name? There's a charming piece of music by Handel, called the Harmonious Blacksmith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like it very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, my dear Handel,&rdquo; said he, turning round as the door opened, &ldquo;here is the dinner, and I must beg of you to take the top of the table, because the dinner is of your providing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This I would not hear of, so he took the top, and I faced him. It was a nice little
<pb n="36" id="p36b"/>
dinner&mdash;seemed to me then, a very Lord Mayor's Feast&mdash;and it acquired additional relish from being eaten under those independent circumstances, with no old people by, and with London all around us. This again was heightened by a certain gipsy character that set the banquet off: for, while the table was, as Mr. Pumblechook might have said, the lap of luxury&mdash;being entirely furnished forth from the coffee-house&mdash;the circumjacent region of sitting-room was of a comparatively pastureless and shifty character: imposing on the waiter the wandering habits of putting the covers on the floor (where he fell over them), the melted butter in the arm-chair, the bread on the bookshelves, the cheese in the coal-scuttle, and the boiled fowl into my bed in the next room&mdash;where I found much of its parsley and butter in a state of congelation when I retired for the night. All this made the feast delightful, and when the waiter was not there to watch me, my pleasure was without alloy.</p>
<p>We had made some progress in the dinner,
<pb n="37" id="p37b"/>
when I reminded Herbert of his promise to tell me about Miss Havisham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I'll redeem it at once. Let me introduce the topic, Handel, by mentioning that in London it is not the custom to put the knife in the mouth&mdash;for fear of accidents&mdash;and that while the fork is reserved for that use, it is not put further in than is necessary. It is scarcely worth mentioning, only it's as well to do as other people do. Also, the spoon is not generally used over-hand, but under. This has two advantages. You get at your mouth better (which after all is the object), and you save a good deal of the attitude of opening oysters, on the part of the right elbow.</p>
<p>He offered these friendly suggestions in such a lively way, that we both laughed and I scarcely blushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he pursued, &ldquo;concerning Miss Havisham. Miss Havisham, you must know, was a spoilt child. Her mother died when she was a baby, and her father denied her nothing. Her father was a country gentleman down in your part of the world, and
<pb n="38" id="p38b"/>
was a brewer. I don't know why it should be a crack thing to be a brewer; but it is indisputable that while you cannot possibly be genteel and bake, you may be as genteel as never was and brew. You see it every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet a gentleman may not keep a public-house; may he?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not on any account,&rdquo; returned Herbert; &ldquo;but a public-house may keep a gentleman. Well! Mr. Havisham was very rich and very proud. So was his daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Havisham was an only child?&rdquo; I hazarded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop a moment, I am coming to that. No, she was not an only child; she had a half-brother. Her father privately married again&mdash;his cook, I rather think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought he was proud,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My good Handel, so he was. He married his second wife privately, because he was proud, and in course of time <hi rend="italics">she</hi> died. When she was dead, I apprehend he first told his daughter what he had done, and then the son became a part of the family, residing in the house you are acquainted with. As the
<pb n="39" id="p39b"/>
son grew a young man, he turned out riotous, extravagant, undutiful&mdash;altogether bad. At last his father disinherited him; but he softened when he was dying, and left him well off, though not nearly so well off as Miss Havisham. Take another glass of wine, and excuse my mentioning that society as a body does not expect one to be so strictly conscientious in emptying one's glass, as to turn it bottom upwards with the rim on one's nose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had been doing this, in an excess of attention to his recital. I thanked him, and apologised. He said, &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; and resumed.</p>
<p>Miss Havisham was now an heiress, and you may suppose was looked after as a great match. Her half-brother had now ample means again, but what with debts and what with new madness wasted them most fearfully again. There were stronger differences between him and her, than there had been between him and his father, and it is suspected that he cherished a deep and mortal grudge against her, as having influenced the father's anger. Now, I come to the cruel
<pb n="40" id="p40b"/>
part of the story&mdash;merely breaking off, my dear Handel, to remark that a dinner-napkin will not go into a tumbler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why I was trying to pack mine into my tumbler, I am wholly unable to say. I only know that I found myself, with a perseverance worthy of a much better cause, making the most strenuous exertions to compress it within those limits. Again I thanked him and apologised, and again he said in the cheerfullest manner, &ldquo;Not at all, I am sure!&rdquo; and resumed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There appeared upon the scene&mdash;say at the races, or the public balls, or anywhere else you like&mdash;a certain man, who made love to Miss Havisham. I never saw him, for this happened five-and-twenty years ago (before you and I were, Handel), but I have heard my father mention that he was a showy-man, and the kind of man for the purpose. But that he was not to be, without ignorance or prejudice, mistaken for a gentleman, my father most strongly asseverates; because it is a principle of his that no man who was not a true gentleman at heart, ever was, since the world began, a
<pb n="41" id="p41b"/>
true gentleman in manner. He says, no varnish can hide the grain of the wood; and that the more varnish you put on, the more the grain will express itself. Well! This man pursued Miss Havisham closely, and professed to be devoted to her. I believe she had not shown much susceptibility up to that time; but all she possessed, certainly came out then, and she passionately loved him. There is no doubt that she perfectly idolised him. He practised on her affection in that systematic way, that he got great sums of money from her, and he induced her to buy her brother out of a share in the brewery (which had been weakly left him by his father) at an immense price, on the plea that when he was her husband he must hold and manage it all. Your guardian was not at that time in Miss Havisham's councils, and she was too haughty and too much in love, to be advised by any one. Her relations were poor and scheming, with the exception of my father; he was poor enough, but not time-serving or jealous. The only independent one among them, he warned her that she was doing too much for
<pb n="42" id="p42b"/>
this man, and was placing herself too unreservedly in his power. She took the first opportunity of angrily ordering my father out of the house, in his presence, and my father has never seen her since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought of her having said, &ldquo;Matthew will come and see me at last when I am laid dead upon that table;&rdquo; and I asked Herbert whether his father was so inveterate against her?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's not that,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but she charged him, in the presence of her intended husband, with being disappointed in the hope of fawning upon her for his own advancement, and, if he were to go to her now, it would look true&mdash;even to him&mdash;and even to her. To return to the man and make an end of him. The marriage day was fixed, the wedding dresses were bought, the wedding tour was planned out, the wedding guests were invited. The day came, but not the bridegroom. He wrote her a letter&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which she received,&rdquo; I struck in, &ldquo;when she was dressing for her marriage? At twenty minutes to nine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the hour and minute,&rdquo; said Herbert,
<pb n="43" id="p43b"/>
nodding, &ldquo;at which she afterwards stopped all the clocks. What was in it, further than that it most heartlessly broke the marriage off, I can't tell you, because I don't know. When she recovered from a bad illness that she had, she laid the whole place waste, as you have seen it, and she has never since looked upon the light of day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all the story?&rdquo; I asked, after considering it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I know of it; and indeed I only know so much, through piecing it out for myself; for my father always avoids it, and, even when Miss Havisham invited me to go there, told me no more of it than it was absolutely requisite I should understand. But I have forgotten one thing. It has been supposed that the man to whom she gave her misplaced confidence, acted throughout in concert with her half-brother; that it was a conspiracy between them; and that they shared the profits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder he didn't marry her and get all the property,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may have been married already, and her cruel mortification may have been a part
<pb n="44" id="p44b"/>
of her half-brother's scheme,&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;Mind! I don't know that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What became of the two men?&rdquo; I asked, after again considering the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They fell into deeper shame and degradation&mdash;if there can be deeper&mdash;and ruin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they alive now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said just now, that Estella was not related to Miss Havisham, but adopted. When adopted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herbert shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;There has always been an Estella, since I have heard of a Miss Havisham. I know no more. And now Handel,&rdquo; said he, finally throwing off the story as it were, &ldquo;there is a perfectly open understanding between us. All that I know about Miss Havisham, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all that I know,&rdquo; I retorted, &ldquo;you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fully believe it. So there can be no competition or perplexity between you and me. And as to the condition on which you hold your advancement in life&mdash;namely, that you are not to inquire or discuss to
<pb n="45" id="p45b"/>
whom you owe it&mdash;you may be very sure that it will never be encroached upon, or even approached, by me, or by any one belonging to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In truth, he said this with so much delicacy, that I felt the subject done with, even though I should be under his father's roof for years and years to come. Yet he said it with so much meaning, too, that I felt he as perfectly understood Miss Havisham to be my benefactress, as I understood the fact myself.</p>
<p>It had not occurred to me before, that he had led up to the theme for the purpose of clearing it out of our way; but we were so much the lighter and easier for having broached it, that I now perceived this to be the case. We were very gay and sociable, and I asked him, in the course of conversation, what he was? He replied, &ldquo;A capitalist&mdash;an Insurer of Ships.&rdquo; I suppose he saw me glancing about the room in search of some tokens of Shipping, or capital, for he added, &ldquo;In the City.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had grand ideas of the wealth and importance of Insurers of Ships in the City,
<pb n="46" id="p46b"/>
and I began to think with awe, of having laid a young Insurer on his back, blackened his enterprising eye, and cut his responsible head open. But, again, there came upon me, for my relief, that odd impression that Herbert Pocket would never be very successful or rich.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not rest satisfied with merely employing my capital in insuring ships. I shall buy up some good Life Assurance shares, and cut into the Direction. I shall also do a little in the mining way. None of these things will interfere with my chartering a few thousand tons on my own account. I think I shall trade,&rdquo; said he, leaning back in his chair, &ldquo;to the East Indies, for silks, shawls, spices, dyes, drugs, and precious woods. It's an interesting trade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the profits are large?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tremendous!&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>I wavered again, and began to think here were greater expectations than my own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I shall trade, also,&rdquo; said he, putting his thumbs in his waistcoat pockets, &ldquo;to the West Indies, for sugar, tobacco, and
<pb n="47" id="p47b"/>
rum. Also to Ceylon, specially for elephants' tusks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will want a good many ships,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A perfect fleet,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>Quite overpowered by the magnificence of these transactions, I asked him where the ships he insured mostly traded to at present?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven't begun insuring yet,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I am looking about me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somehow, that pursuit seemed more in keeping with Barnard's Inn. I said (in a tone of conviction), &ldquo;Ah-h!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I am in a counting-house, and looking about me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is a counting-house profitable?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To&mdash;do you mean to the young fellow who's in it?&rdquo; he asked, in reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, n-no: not to me.&rdquo; He said this with the air of one carefully reckoning up and striking a balance. &ldquo;Not directly profitable. That is, it doesn't pay me anything, and I have to&mdash;keep myself.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="48" id="p48b"/>
<p>This certainly had not a profitable appearance, and I shook my head as if I would imply that it would be difficult to lay by much accumulative capital from such a source of income.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the thing is,&rdquo; said Herbert Pocket, &ldquo;that you look about you. <hi rend="italics">That's</hi> the grand thing. You are in a counting-house, you know, and you look about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It struck me as a singular implication that you couldn't be out of a counting-house, you know, and look about you; but I silently deferred to his experience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the time comes,&rdquo; said Herbert, &ldquo;when you see your opening. And you go in, and you swoop upon it and you make your capital, and then there you are! When you have once made your capital, you have nothing to do but employ it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was very like his way of conducting that encounter in the garden; very like. His manner of bearing his poverty; too, exactly corresponded to his manner of bearing that defeat. It seemed to me that he took all blows and buffets now, with just the same air as he had taken mine then. It
<pb n="49" id="p49b"/>
was evident that he had nothing around him but the simplest necessaries, for everything that I remarked upon turned out to have been sent in on my account from the coffee-house or somewhere else.</p>
<p>Yet, having already made his fortune in his own mind, he was so unassuming with it that I felt quite grateful to him for not being puffed up. It was a pleasant addition to his naturally pleasant ways, and we got on famously. In the evening we went out for a walk in the streets, and went half-price to the Theatre; and next day we went to church at Westminster Abbey, and in the afternoon we walked in the Parks; and I wondered who shod all the horses there, and wished Joe did.</p>
<p>On a moderate computation, it was many months, that Sunday, since I had left Joe and Biddy. The space interposed between myself and them, partook of that expansion, and our marshes were any distance off. That I could have been at our old church in my old church-going clothes, on the very last Sunday that ever was, seemed a combination of impossibilities, geographical and
<pb n="50" id="p50b"/>
social, solar and lunar. Yet in the London streets, so crowded with people and so brilliantly lighted in the dusk of evening, there were depressing hints of reproaches for that I had put the poor old kitchen at home so far away; and in the dead of night, the footsteps of some incapable imposter of a porter mooning about Barnard's Inn, under pretence of watching it, fell hollow on my heart.</p>
<p>On the Monday morning at a quarter before nine, Herbert went to the counting-house to report himself&mdash;to look about him, too, I suppose&mdash;and I bore him company. He was to come away in an hour or two to attend me to Hammersmith, and I was to wait about for him. It appeared to me that the eggs from which young Insurers were hatched, were incubated in dust and heat, like the eggs of ostriches, judging from the places to which those incipient giants repaired on a Monday morning. Nor did the counting-house where Herbert assisted, show in my eyes as at all a good Observatory; being a back second floor up a yard, of a grimy presence in all particulars, and with
<pb n="51" id="p51b"/>
a look into another back second floor, rather than a look out.</p>
<p>I waited about until it was noon, and I went upon 'Change, and I saw fluey men sitting there under the bills about shipping, whom I took to be great merchants, though I couldn't understand why they should all be out of spirits. When Herbert came, we went and had lunch at a celebrated house which I then quite venerated, but now believe to have been the most abject superstition in Europe, and where I could not help noticing, even then, that there was much more gravy on the tablecloths and knives and waiters' clothes, than in the steaks. This collation disposed of at a moderate price (considering the grease: which was not charged for), we went back to Barnard's Inn and got my little portmanteau, and then took coach for Hammersmith. We arrived there at two or three o'clock in the afternoon, and had very little way to walk to Mr. Pocket's house. Lifting the latch of a gate, we passed direct into a little garden overlooking the river, where Mr. Pocket's children were playing about. And unless I
<pb n="52" id="p52b"/>
deceive myself on a point where my interests or prepossessions are certainly not concerned, I saw that Mr. and Mrs. Pocket's children were not growing up or being brought up, but were tumbling up.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pocket was sitting on a garden chair under a tree, reading, with her legs upon another garden chair; and Mrs. Pocket's two nursemaids, were looking about them while the children played. &ldquo;Mamma,&rdquo; said Herbert, &ldquo;this is young Mr. Pip.&rdquo; Upon which Mrs. Pocket received me with an appearance of amiable dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master Alick and Miss Jane,&rdquo; cried one of the nurses to two of the children, &ldquo;if you go a bouncing up against them bushes you'll fall over into the river and be drownded, and what'll your pa say then!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the same time this nurse picked up Mrs. Pocket's handkerchief, and said, &ldquo;If that don't make six times you've dropped it, Mum!&rdquo; Upon which Mrs. Pocket laughed and said, &ldquo;Thank you, Flopson,&rdquo; and settling herself in one chair only, resumed her book. Her countenance immediately assumed a knitted and intent expression as if she had
<pb n="53" id="p53b"/>
been reading for a week, but before she could have read half a dozen lines, she fixed her eyes upon me, and said, &ldquo;I hope your mamma is quite well?&rdquo; This unexpected inquiry put me into such a difficulty that I began saying in the absurdest way that if there had been any such person I had no doubt she would have been quite well and would have been very much obliged and would have sent her compliments, when the nurse came to my rescue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; she cried, picking up the pocket-handkerchief, &ldquo;if that don't make seven times! What ARE you a doing of this afternoon, Mum!&rdquo; Mrs. Pocket received her property, at first with a look of unutterable surprise as if she had never seen it before, and then with a laugh of recognition, and said, &ldquo;Thank you, Flopson,&rdquo; and forgot me, and went on reading.</p>
<p>I found, now I had leisure to count them, that there were no fewer than six little Pockets present, in various stages of tumbling up. I had scarcely arrived at the total when a seventh was heard, as in the region of air, wailing dolefully.</p>
<pb n="54" id="p54b"/>
<p>&ldquo;If there ain't Baby!&rdquo; said Flopson, appearing to think it most surprising. &ldquo;Make haste up, Millers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Millers, who was the other nurse, retired into the house, and by degrees the child's wailing was hushed and stopped, as if it were a young ventriloquist with something in its mouth. Mrs. Pocket read all the time, and I was curious to know what the book could be.</p>
<p>We were waiting, I supposed, for Mr. Pocket to come out to us; at any rate we waited there, and so I had an opportunity of observing the remarkable family phenomenon that whenever any of the children strayed near Mrs. Pocket in their play, they always tripped themselves up and tumbled over her&mdash;always very much to her momentary astonishment, and their own more enduring lamentation. I was at a loss to account for this surprising circumstance, and could not help giving my mind to speculations about it, until by-and-by Millers came down with the baby, which baby was handed to Flopson, which Flopson was handing it to
<pb n="55" id="p55b"/>
Mrs. Pocket, when she too went fairly headforemost over Mrs. Pocket, baby and all, and was caught by Herbert and myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious me, Flopson!&rdquo; said Mrs. Pocket, looking off her book for a moment, &ldquo;everybody's tumbling!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious you, indeed, Mum!&rdquo; returned Flopson, very red in the face; &ldquo;what have you got there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italics">I</hi> got here, Flopson?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, if it ain't your footstool!&rdquo; cried Flopson. &ldquo;And if you keep it under your skirts like that, who's to help tumbling! Here! Take the baby, Mum, and give me your book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Pocket acted on the advice, and inexpertly danced the infant a little in her lap, while the other children played about it. This had lasted but a very short time, when Mrs. Pocket issued summary orders that they were all to be taken into the house for a nap. Thus I made the second discovery on that first occasion, that the nurture of the little Pockets consisted of alternately tumbling up and lying down.</p>
<pb n="56" id="p56b"/>
<p>Under these circumstances, when Flopson and Millers had got the children into the house, like a little flock of sheep, and Mr. Pocket came out of it to make my acquaintance, I was not much surprised to find that Mr. Pocket was a gentleman with a rather perplexed expression of face, and with his very grey hair disordered on his head, as if he didn't quite see his way to putting anything straight.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter">
<pb n="57" id="p57b"/>
<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<p>MR. POCKET said he was glad to see me, and he hoped I was not sorry to see him. &ldquo;For, I really am not,&rdquo; he added, with his son's smile, &ldquo;an alarming personage.&rdquo; He was a young-looking-man, in spite of his perplexities and his very grey hair, and his manner seemed quite natural. I use the word natural, in the sense of its being unaffected; there was something comic in his distraught way, as though it would have been downright ludicrous but for his own perception that it was very near being so. When he had talked with me a little, he said to Mrs. Pocket, with a rather anxious contraction of his eyebrows, which were
<pb n="58" id="p58b"/>
black and handsome, &ldquo;Belinda, I hope you have welcomed Mr. Pip?&rdquo; And she looked up from her book, and said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; She then smiled upon me in an absent state of mind, and asked me if I liked the taste of orange-flower water? As the question had no bearing, near or remote, on any foregone or subsequent transaction, I consider it to have been thrown out, like her previous approaches, in general conversational condescension.</p>
<p>I found out within a few hours, and may mention at once, that Mrs. Pocket was the only daughter of a certain quite accidental deceased Knight, who had invented for himself a conviction that his deceased father would have been made a Baronet but for somebody's determined opposition arising out of entirely personal motives&mdash;I forget whose, if I ever knew&mdash;the Sovereign's, the Prime Minister's, the Lord Chancellor's, the Archbishop of Canterbury's, anybody's&mdash;and had tacked himself on to the nobles of the earth in right of this quite supposititious fact. I believe he had been knighted himself for storming the English grammar at the
<pb n="59" id="p59b"/>
point of the pen, in a desperate address engrossed on vellum, on the occasion of the laying of the first stone of some building or other, and for handing some Royal Person-age either the trowel or the mortar. Be that as it may, he had directed Mrs. Pocket to be brought up from her cradle as one who in the nature of things must marry a title, and who was to be guarded from the acquisition of plebeian domestic knowledge. So successful a watch and ward had been established over the young lady by this judicious parent, that she had grown up highly ornamental, but perfectly helpless and useless. With her character thus happily formed, in the first bloom of her youth she had encountered Mr. Pocket: who was also in the first bloom of youth, and not quite decided whether to mount to the Woolsack, or to roof himself in with a mitre. As his doing the one or the other was a mere question of time, he and Mrs. Pocket had taken Time by the forelock (when, to judge from its length, it would seem to have wanted cutting), and had married without the knowledge of the judicious parent. The
<pb n="60" id="p60b"/>
judicious parent, having nothing to bestow or withhold but his blessing, had handsomely settled that dower upon them after a short struggle, and had informed Mr. Pocket that his wife was &ldquo;a treasure for a Prince.&rdquo; Mr. Pocket had invested the Prince's treasure in the ways of the world ever since, and it was supposed to have brought him in but indifferent interest. Still, Mrs. Pocket was in general the object of a queer sort of respectful pity, because she had not married a title; while Mr. Pocket was the object of a queer sort of forgiving reproach, because he had never got one.</p>
<p>Mr. Pocket took me into the house and showed me my room: which was a pleasant one, and so furnished as that I could use it with comfort for my own private sitting-room. He then knocked at the doors of two other similar rooms, and introduced me to their occupants, by name Drummle and Startop. Drummle, an old-looking young man of a heavy order of architecture, was whistling. Startop, younger in years and appearance, was reading and holding his head, as if he thought himself in danger of
<pb n="61" id="p61b"/>
exploding it with too strong a charge of knowledge.</p>
<p>Both Mr. and Mrs. Pocket had such a noticeable air of being in somebody else's hands, that I wondered who really was in possession of the house and let them live there, until I found this unknown power to be the servants. It was a smooth way of going on, perhaps, in respect of saving trouble; but it had the appearance of being expensive, for the servants felt it a duty they owed to themselves to be nice in their eating and drinking, and to keep a deal of company down stairs. They allowed a very liberal table to Mr. and Mrs. Pocket, yet it always appeared to me that by far the best part of the house to have boarded in, would have been the kitchen&mdash;always supposing the boarder capable of self-defence, for, before I had been there a week, a neighbouring lady with whom the family were personally unacquainted, wrote in to say that she had seen Millers slapping the baby. This greatly distressed Mrs. Pocket, who burst into tears on receiving the note, and said it was an extraordinary thing that the
<pb n="62" id="p62b"/>
neighbours couldn't mind their own business.</p>
<p>By degrees I learnt, and chiefly from Herbert, that Mr. Pocket had been educated at Harrow and at Cambridge, where he had distinguished himself; but that when he had had the happiness of marrying Mrs. Pocket very early in life, he had impaired his prospects and taken up the calling of a Grinder. After grinding a number of dull blades&mdash;of whom it was remarkable that their fathers, when influential, were always going to help him to preferment, but always forgot to do it when the blades had left the Grindstone&mdash;he had wearied of that poor work and had come to London. Here, after gradually failing in loftier hopes, he had &ldquo;read&rdquo; with divers who had lacked opportunities or neglected them, and had refurbished divers others for special occasions, and had turned his acquirements to the account of literary compilation and correction, and on such means, added to some very moderate private resources, still maintained the house I saw.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Pocket had a toady neighbour;
<pb n="63" id="p63b"/>
a widow lady of that highly <sic corr="sympathetic">sympathethic</sic> nature that she agreed with everybody, blessed everybody, and shed smiles and tears on everybody, according to circumstances. This lady's name was Mrs. Coiler, and I had the honour of taking her down to dinner on the day of my installation. She gave me to understand on the stairs, that it was a blow to dear Mrs. Pocket that dear Mr. Pocket should be under the necessity of receiving gentlemen to read with him. That did not extend to me, she told me in a gush of love and confidence (at that time, I had known her something less than five minutes); if they were all like Me, it would be quite another thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But dear <sic corr="Mrs.">Mrs</sic> Pocket,&rdquo; said Mrs. Coiler, &ldquo;after her early disappointment (not that dear Mr. Pocket was to blame in that), requires so much luxury and elegance&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma'am,&rdquo; I said, to stop her, for I was afraid she was going to cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she is of so aristocratic a disposition&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="64" id="p64b"/>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma'am,&rdquo; I said again, with the same object as before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;that it <hi rend="italics">is</hi> hard,&rdquo; said Mrs. Coiler, &ldquo;to have dear Mr. Pocket's time and attention diverted from dear Mrs. Pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could not help thinking that it might be harder if the butcher's time and attention were diverted from dear Mrs. Pocket; but I said nothing, and indeed had enough to do in keeping a bashful watch upon my company-manners.</p>
<p>It came to my knowledge, through what passed between Mrs. Pocket and Drummle while I was attentive to my knife and fork, spoon, glasses, and other instruments of self-destruction, that Drummle, whose christian name was Bentley, was actually the next heir but one to a baronetcy. It further appeared that the book I had seen Mrs. Pocket reading in the garden, was all about titles, and that she knew the exact date at which her grandpapa would have come into the book, if he ever had come at all. Drummle didn't say much, but in his limited way (he struck me as a sulky kind of fellow) he spoke as one of the elect, and recognised Mrs.
<pb n="65" id="p65b"/>
Pocket as a woman and a sister. No one but themselves and Mrs. Coiler the toady neighbour showed any interest in this part of the conversation, and it appeared to me that it was painful to Herbert; but it promised to last a long time, when the page came in with the announcement of a domestic affliction. It was, in effect, that the cook had mislaid the beef. To my unutterable amazement, I now, for the first time, saw Mr. Pocket relieve his mind by going through a performance that struck me as very extraordinary, but which made no impression on anybody else, and with which I soon became as familiar as the rest. He laid down the carving-knife and fork&mdash;being engaged in carving, at the moment&mdash;put his two hands into his disturbed hair, and appeared to make an extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it. When he had done this, and had not lifted himself up at all, he quietly went on with what he was about.</p>
<p>Mrs. Coiler then changed the subject, and began to flatter me. I liked it for a few moments, but she flattered me so very grossly that the pleasure was soon over. She had
<pb n="66" id="p66b"/>
a serpentine way of coming close at me when she pretended to be vitally interested in the friends and localities I had left, which was altogether snaky and fork-tongued; and when she made an occasional bounce upon Startop (who said very little to her), or upon Drummle (who said less), I rather envied them for being on the opposite side of the table.</p>
<p>After dinner the children were introduced, and Mrs. Coiler made admiring comments on their eyes, noses, and legs&mdash;a sagacious way of improving their minds. There were four little girls, and two little boys, besides the baby who might have been either, and the baby's next successor who was as yet neither. They were brought in by Flopson and Millers, much as though those two non-commissioned officers had been recruiting somewhere for children and had enlisted these: while Mrs. Pocket looked at the young Nobles that ought to have been, as if she rather thought she had had the pleasure of inspecting them before, but didn't quite know what to make of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here! Give me your fork, Mum, and
<pb n="67" id="p67b"/>
take the baby,&rdquo; said Flopson. &ldquo;Don't take it that way, or you'll get its head under the table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus advised, Mrs. Pocket took it the other way, and got its head upon the table; which was announced to all present by a prodigious concussion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, dear! Give it me back, Mum,&rdquo; said Flopson; &ldquo;and Miss Jane, come and dance to baby, do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the little girls, a mere mite who seemed to have prematurely taken upon herself some charge of the others, stepped out of her place by me, and danced to and from the baby until it left off crying, and laughed. Then, all the children laughed, and Mr. Pocket (who in the mean time had twice endeavoured to lift himself up by the hair) laughed, and we all laughed and were glad.</p>
<p>Flopson, by dint of doubling the baby at the joints like a Dutch doll, then got it safely into Mrs. Pocket's lap, and gave it the nutcrackers to play with: at the same time recommending Mrs. Pocket to take notice that the handles of that instrument were
<pb n="68" id="p68b"/>
not likely to agree with its eyes, and sharply charging Miss Jane to look after the same. Then, the two nurses left the room, and had a lively scuffle on the staircase with a dissipated page who had waited at dinner, and who had clearly lost half his buttons at the gaming-table.</p>
<p>I was made very uneasy in my mind by Mrs. Pocket's falling into a discussion with Drummle respecting two baronetcies, while she ate a sliced orange steeped in sugar and wine, and forgetting all about the baby on her lap: who did most appalling things with the nutcrackers. At length, little Jane perceiving its young brains to be imperiled, softly left her place, and with many small artifices coaxed the dangerous weapon away. Mrs. Pocket finishing her orange at about the same time, and not approving of this, said to Jane:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You naughty child, how dare you? Go and sit down this instant!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma dear,&rdquo; lisped the little girl, &ldquo;baby ood have put hith eyeth out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dare you tell me so?&rdquo; retorted
<pb n="69" id="p69b"/>
Mrs. Pocket. &ldquo;Go and sit down in your chair this moment!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Pocket's dignity was so crushing, that I felt quite abashed: as if I myself had done something to rouse it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Belinda,&rdquo; remonstrated Mr. Pocket, from the other end of the table, &ldquo;how can you be so unreasonable? Jane only interfered for the protection of baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not allow anybody to interfere,&rdquo; said Mrs. Pocket. &ldquo;I am surprised, Matthew, that you should expose me to the affront of interference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; cried Mr. Pocket, in an outbreak of desolate desperation. &ldquo;Are infants to be nutcrackered into their tombs, and is nobody to save them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not be interfered with by Jane,&rdquo; said Mrs. Pocket, with a majestic glance at that innocent little offender. &ldquo;I hope I know my poor grandpapa's position. Jane, indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pocket got his hands in his hair again, and this time really did lift himself some inches out of his chair. &ldquo;Hear this!&rdquo; he
<pb n="70" id="p70b"/>
helplessly exclaimed to the elements. &ldquo;Babies are to be nutcrackered dead, for people's poor grandpapa's positions!&rdquo; Then he let himself down again, and became silent.</p>
<p>We all looked awkwardly at the table-cloth while this was going on. A pause succeeded, during which the honest and irrepressible baby made a series of leaps and crows at little Jane, who appeared to me to be the only member of the family (irrespective of servants) with whom it had any decided acquaintance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Drummle,&rdquo; said Mrs. Pocket, &ldquo;will you ring for Flopson? Jane, you undutiful little thing, go and lie down. Now, baby darling, come with ma!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The baby was the soul of honour, and protested with all its might. It doubled itself up the wrong way over Mrs. Pocket's arm, exhibited a pair of knitted shoes and dimpled ankles to the company in lieu of its soft face, and was carried out in the highest state of mutiny. And it gained its point after all, for I saw it through the window within a few minutes, being nursed by little Jane.</p>
<pb n="71" id="p71b"/>
<p>It happened that the other five children were left behind at the dinner-table, through Flopson's having some private engagement, and their not being anybody else's business. I thus became aware of the mutual relations between them and Mr. Pocket, which were exemplified in the following manner. Mr. Pocket, with the normal perplexity of his face heightened and his hair rumpled, looked at them for some minutes, as if he couldn't make out how they came to be boarding and lodging in that establishment, and why they hadn't been billeted by Nature on somebody else. Then, in a distant, Missionary way he asked them certain questions&mdash;as why little Joe had that hole in his frill: who said, Pa, Flopson was going to mend it when she had time&mdash;and how little Fanny came by that whitlow: who said, Pa, Millers was going to poultice it when she didn't forget. Then, he melted into parental tenderness, and gave them a shilling apiece and told them to go and play; and then as they went out, with one very strong effort to lift himself up by the hair he dismissed the hopeless subject.</p>
<p>In the evening there was rowing on the
<pb n="72" id="p72b"/>
river. As Drummle and Startop had each a boat, I resolved to set up mine, and to cut them both out. I was pretty good at most exercises in which country-boys are adepts, but, as I was conscious of wanting elegance of style for the Thames&mdash;not to say for other waters&mdash;I at once engaged to place myself under the tuition of the winner of a prize-wherry who plied at our stairs, and to whom I was introduced by my new allies. This practical authority confused me very much, by saying I had the arm of a blacksmith. If he could have known how nearly the compliment lost him his pupil, I doubt if he would have paid it.</p>
<p>There was a supper-tray after we got home at night, and I think we should all have enjoyed ourselves, but for a rather disagreeable domestic occurrence. Mr. Pocket was in good spirits, when a housemaid came in, and said, &ldquo;If you please, sir, I should wish to speak to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak to your master?&rdquo; said Mrs. Pocket, whose dignity was roused again. &ldquo;How can you think of such a thing? Go and speak
<pb n="73" id="p73b"/>
to Flopson. Or speak to me&mdash;at some other time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Begging your pardon, ma'am?&rdquo; returned the housemaid, &ldquo;I should wish to speak at once, and to speak to master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hereupon, Mr. Pocket went out of the room, and we made the best of ourselves until he came back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a pretty thing, Belinda!&rdquo; said Mr. Pocket, returning with a countenance expressive of grief and despair. &ldquo;Here's the cook lying insensibly drunk on the kitchen floor, with a large bundle of fresh butter made up in the cupboard ready to sell for grease!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Pocket instantly showed much amiable emotion, and said, &ldquo;This is that odious Sophia's doing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Belinda?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sophia has told you,&rdquo; said Mrs. Pocket. &ldquo;Did I not see her with my own eyes and hear her with my own ears, come into the room just now and ask to speak to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But has she not taken me down stairs,
<pb n="74" id="p74b"/>
Belinda,&rdquo; returned Mr. Pocket, &ldquo;and shown me the woman, and the bundle too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you defend her, Matthew,&rdquo; said Mrs. Pocket, &ldquo;for making mischief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pocket uttered a dismal groan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I, grandpapa's granddaughter, to be nothing in the house?&rdquo; said Mrs. Pocket. &ldquo;Besides, the cook has always been a very nice respectful woman, and said in the most natural manner when she came to look after the situation, that she felt I was born to be a Duchess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a sofa where Mr. Pocket stood, and he dropped upon it in the attitude of the Dying Gladiator. Still, in that attitude he said, with a hollow voice, &ldquo;Good night, Mr. Pip,&rdquo; when I deemed it advisable to go to bed and leave him.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter">
<pb n="75" id="p75b"/>
<head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<p>AFTER two or three days, when I had established myself in my room and had gone backwards and forwards to London several times, and had ordered all I wanted of my tradesmen, Mr. Pocket and I had a long talk together. He knew more of my intended career than I knew myself, for he referred to his having been told by Mr. Jaggers that I was not designed for any profession, and that I should be well enough educated for my destiny if I could &ldquo;hold my own&rdquo; with the average of young men in prosperous circumstances. I acquiesced, of course, knowing nothing to the contrary.</p>
<pb n="76" id="p76b"/>
<p>He advised my attending certain places in London, for the acquisition of such mere rudiments as I wanted, and my investing him with the functions of explainer and director of all my studies. He hoped that with intelligent assistance I should meet with little to discourage me, and should soon be able to dispense with any aid but his. Through his way of saying this, and much more to similar purpose, he placed himself on confidential terms with me in an admirable manner; and I may state at once that he was always so zealous and honourable in fulfilling his compact with me, that he made me zealous and honourable in fulfilling mine with him. If he had shown indifference as a master, I have no doubt I should have returned the compliment as a pupil; he gave me no such excuse, and each of us did the other justice. Nor, did I ever regard him as having anything ludicrous about him&mdash;or anything but what was serious, honest, and good&mdash;in his tutor communication with me.</p>
<p>When these points were settled, and so far carried out as that I had begun to work
<pb n="77" id="p77b"/>
in earnest, it occurred to me that if I could retain my bedroom in Barnard's Inn, my life would be agreeably varied, while my manners would be none the worse for Herbert's society. Mr. Pocket did not object to this arrangement, but urged that before any step could possibly be taken in it, it must be submitted to my guardian. I felt that his delicacy arose out of the consideration that the plan would save Herbert some expense, so I went off to Little Britain and imparted my wish to Mr. Jaggers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I could buy the furniture now hired for me,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and one or two other little things, I should be quite at home there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go it!&rdquo; said Mr. Jaggers, with a short laugh. &ldquo;I told you you'd get on. Well! How much do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said I didn't know how much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; retorted Mr. Jaggers. &ldquo;How much? Fifty pounds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, not nearly so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five pounds?&rdquo; said Mr. Jaggers.</p>
<p>This was such a great fall, that I said in discomfiture, &ldquo;Oh! more than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than that, eh?&rdquo; retorted Mr. Jaggers,
<pb n="78" id="p78b"/>
lying in wait for me, with his hands in his pockets, his head on one side, and his eyes on the wall behind me; &ldquo;how much more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is so difficult to fix a sum,&rdquo; said I, hesitating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; said Mr. Jaggers. &ldquo;Let's get at it. Twice five; will that do? Three times five; will that do? Four times five; will that do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said I thought that would do handsomely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four times five will do handsomely, will it?&rdquo; said Mr. Jaggers, knitting his brows. &ldquo;Now, what do you make of four times five?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I make of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Mr. Jaggers; &ldquo;how much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you make it twenty pounds,&rdquo; said I, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind what <hi rend="italics">I</hi> make it, my friend,&rdquo; observed Mr. Jaggers, with a knowing and contradictory toss of his head. &ldquo;I want to know what <hi rend="italics">you</hi> make it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty pounds, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wemmick!&rdquo; said Mr. Jaggers, opening
<pb n="79" id="p79b"/>
his office door. &ldquo;Take Mr. Pip's written order, and pay him twenty pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This strongly marked way of doing business made a strongly marked impression on me, and that not of an agreeable kind. Mr. Jaggers never laughed; but he wore great bright creaking boots, and, in poising himself on these boots, with his large head bent down and his eyebrows joined together, awaiting an answer, he sometimes caused the boots to creak, as if <hi rend="italics">they</hi> laughed in a dry and suspicious way. As he happened to go out now, and as Wemmick was brisk and talkative, I said to Wemmick that I hardly knew what to make of Mr. Jaggers's manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him that, and he'll take it as a compliment,&rdquo; answered Wemmick; &ldquo;he don't mean that you <hi rend="italics">should</hi> know what to make of it.&mdash;Oh!&rdquo; for I looked surprised, &ldquo;it's not personal; it's professional: only professional.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wemmick was at his desk, lunching&mdash;and crunching&mdash;on a dry hard biscuit; pieces of which he threw from time to time into his slit of a mouth, as if he were posting them.</p>
<pb n="80" id="p80b"/>
<p>&ldquo;Always seems to me,&rdquo; said Wemmick, &ldquo;as if he had set a man-trap and was watching it. Suddenly&mdash;click&mdash;you're caught!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without remarking that man-traps were not among the amenities of life, I said I supposed he was very skilful?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deep,&rdquo; said Wemmick, &ldquo;as Australia.&rdquo; Pointing with his pen at the office floor, to express that Australia was understood, for the purposes of the figure, to be symmetrically on the opposite spot of the globe. &ldquo;If there was anything deeper,&rdquo; added Wemmick, bringing his pen to paper, &ldquo;he'd be it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, I said I supposed he had a fine business, and Wemmick said, &ldquo;Ca-pi-tal!&rdquo; Then I asked if there were many clerks? to which he replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don't run much into clerks, because there's only one Jaggers, and people won't have him at second hand. There are only four of us. Would you like to see'em? You are one of us, as I may say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I accepted the offer. When Mr. Wemmick had put all the biscuit into the post, and had paid me my money from a cash-box
<pb n="81" id="p81b"/>
in a safe, the key of which safe he kept somewhere down his back and produced from his coat-collar like an iron pigtail, we went up-stairs. The house was dark and shabby, and the greasy shoulders that had left their mark in Mr. Jaggers's room, seemed to have been shuffling up and down the staircase for years. In the front first floor, a clerk who looked something between a publican and a rat-catcher&mdash;a large pale puffed swollen man&mdash;was attentively engaged with three or four people of shabby appearance, whom he treated as unceremoniously as everybody seemed to be treated who contributed to Mr. Jaggers's coffers. &ldquo;Getting evidence together,&rdquo; said Mr. Wemmick, as we came out, &ldquo;for the Bailey.&rdquo; In the room over that, a little flabby terrier of a clerk with dangling hair (his cropping seemed to have been forgotten when he was a puppy) was similarly engaged with a man with weak eyes, whom Mr. Wemmick presented to me as a smelter who kept his pot always boiling, and who would melt me anything I pleased&mdash;and who was in an excessive white-perspiration,
<pb n="82" id="p82b"/>
as if he had been trying his art on himself. In a back room, a high-shouldered man with a face-ache tied up in dirty flannel, who was dressed in old black clothes that bore the appearance of having been waxed, was stooping over his work of making fair copies of the notes of the other two gentlemen, for Mr. Jaggers's own use.</p>
<p>This was all the establishment. When we went down stairs again, Wemmick led me into my guardian's room, and said, &ldquo;This you've seen already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray,&rdquo; said I, as the two odious casts with the twitchy leer upon them caught my sight again, &ldquo;whose likenesses are those?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These?&rdquo; said Wemmick, getting upon a chair, and blowing the dust off the horrible heads before bringing them down. &ldquo;These are two celebrated ones. Famous clients of ours that got us a world of credit. This chap (why you must have come down in the night and been peeping into the inkstand, to get this blot upon your eyebrow, you old rascal!) murdered his master, and, considering that he wasn't brought up to evidence, didn't plan it badly.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="83" id="p83b"/>
<p>&ldquo;Is it like him?&rdquo; I asked, recoiling from the brute, as Wemmick spat upon his eyebrow and gave it a rub with his sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like him? It's himself, you know. The cast was made in Newgate, directly after he was taken down. You had a particular fancy for me, hadn't you, Old Artful?&rdquo; said Wemmick. He then explained this affectionate apostrophe, by touching his brooch representing the lady and the weeping willow at the tomb with the urn upon it, and saying, &ldquo;Had it made for me, express!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the lady anybody?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned Wemmick. &ldquo;Only his game. (You liked your bit of game, didn't you?) No; deuce a bit of a lady in the case, Mr. Pip, except one&mdash;and she wasn't of this slender ladylike sort, and you wouldn't have caught <hi rend="italics">her</hi> looking after this urn&mdash;unless there was something to drink in it.&rdquo; Wemmick's attention being thus directed to his brooch, he put down the cast, and polished the brooch with his pocket-hand-kerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did that other creature come to the
<pb n="84" id="p84b"/>
same end?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;He has the same look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You're right,&rdquo; said Wemmick; &ldquo;it's the genuine look. Much as if one nostril was caught up with a horsehair and a little fishhook. Yes, he came to the same end; quite the natural end here, I assure you. He forged wills, this blade did, if he didn't also put the supposed testators to sleep too. You were a gentlemanly Cove, though&rdquo; (Mr. Wemmick was again apostrophising), &ldquo;and you said you could write Greek. Yah, Bounceable! What a lair you were. I never met such a liar as you!&rdquo; Before putting his late friend on his shelf again, Wemmick touched the largest of his mourning rings, and said, &ldquo;Sent out to buy it for me, only the day before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he was putting up the other cast and coming down from the chair, the thought crossed my mind that all his personal jewellery was derived from like sources. As he had shown no diffidence on the subject, I ventured on the liberty of asking him the question, when he stood before me, dusting his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; he returned, &ldquo;these are all
<pb n="85" id="p85b"/>
gifts of that kind. One brings another, you see; that's the way of it. I always take 'em. They're curiosities. And they're property. They may not be worth much, but, after all, they're property and portable. It don't signify to you with your brilliant lookout, but as to myself, my guiding-star always is, &ldquo;Get hold of portable property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I had rendered homage to this light, he went on to say, in a friendly manner:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If at any odd time when you have nothing better to do, you wouldn't mind coming over to see me at Walworth, I could offer you a bed, and I should consider it an honour. I have not much to show you; but such two or three curiosities as I have got, you might like to look over; and I am fond of a bit of garden and a summer-house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said I should be delighted to accept his hospitality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thankee,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;then we'll consider that it's to come off, when convenient to you. Have you dined with Mr. Jaggers yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="86" id="p86b"/>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Wemmick, &ldquo;he'll give you wine, and good wine. I'll give you punch, and not bad punch. And now I'll tell you something. When you go to dine with Mr. Jaggers, look at his housekeeper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I see something very uncommon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Wemmick, &ldquo;you'll see a wild beast tamed. Not so very uncommon, you'll tell me. I reply, that depends on the original wildness of the beast, and the amount of taming. It won't lower your opinion of Mr. Jaggers's powers. Keep your eye on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told him I would do so, with all the interest and curiosity that his preparation awakened. As I was taking my departure, he asked me if I would like to devote five minutes to seeing Mr. Jaggers &ldquo;at it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For several reasons, and not least because I didn't clearly know what Mr. Jaggers would be found to be &ldquo;at,&rdquo; I replied in the affirmative. We dived into the City, and came up in a crowded police-court, where a blood-relation (in the murderous sense) of the deceased with the fanciful taste
<pb n="87" id="p87b"/>
in brooches, was standing at the bar, uncomfortably chewing something; while my guardian had a woman under examination or cross-examination&mdash;I don't know which&mdash;and was striking her, and the bench, and everybody present, with awe. If anybody, of whatsoever degree, said a word that he didn't approve of, he instantly required to have it &ldquo;taken down.&rdquo; If anybody wouldn't make an admission, he said, &ldquo;I'll have it out of you!&rdquo; and if anybody made an admission, he said, &ldquo;Now I have got you!&rdquo; The magistrates shivered under a single bite of his finger. Thieves and thief-takers hung in dread rapture on his words, and shrank when a hair of his eyebrows turned in their direction. Which side he was on, I couldn't make out, for he seemed to me to be grinding the whole place in a mill; I only know that when I stole out on tiptoe, he was not on the side of the bench; for, he was making the legs of the old gentleman who presided, quite convulsive under the table, by his denunciations of his conduct as the representative of British law and justice in that chair that day.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<p>BENTLEY DRUMMLE, who was so sulky a fellow that he even took up a book as if its writer had done him an injury, did not take up an acquaintance in a more agreeable spirit. Heavy in figure, movement, and comprehension&mdash;in the sluggish complexion of his face, and in the large awkward tongue that seemed to loll about in his mouth as he himself lolled about in a room&mdash;he was idle, proud, niggardly, reserved, and suspicious. He came of rich people down in Somersetshire, who had nursed this combination of qualities until they made the discovery that it was just of age and a blockhead. Thus, Bentley Drummle had come to Mr. Pocket
<pb n="89" id="p89b"/>
when he was a head taller than that gentleman, and half a dozen heads thicker than most gentlemen.</p>
<p>Startop had been spoilt by a weak mother and kept at home when he ought to have been at school, but he was devotedly attached to her, and admired her beyond measure. He had a woman's delicacy of feature, and was&mdash;&ldquo;as you may see, though you never saw her,&rdquo; said Herbert to me&mdash;exactly like his mother. It was but natural that I should take to him much more kindly than to Drummle, and that, even in the earliest evenings of our boating, he and I should pull homeward abreast of one another, conversing from boat to boat, while Bentley Drummle came up in our wake alone, under the overhanging banks and among the rushes. He would always creep in-shore like some uncomfortable amphibious creature, even when the tide would have sent him fast upon his way; and I always think of him as coming after us in the dark or by the back-water, when our own two boats were breaking the sunset or the moonlight in mid-stream.</p>
<pb n="90" id="p90b"/>
<p>Herbert was my intimate companion and friend. I presented him with a half-share in my boat, which was the occasion of his often coming down to Hammersmith; and my possession of a half-share in his chambers often took me up to London. We used to walk between the two places at all hours. I have an affection for the road yet (though it is not so pleasant a road as it was then), formed in the impressibility of untried youth and hope.</p>
<p>When I had been in Mr. Pocket's family a month or two, Mr. and Mrs. Camilla turned up. Camilla was Mr. Pocket's sister. Georgiana, whom I had seen at Miss Havisham's on the same occasion, also turned up. She was a cousin&mdash;an indigestive single woman, who called her rigidity religion, and her liver love. These people hated me with the hatred of cupidity and disappointment. As a matter of course, they fawned upon me in my prosperity with the basest meanness. Towards Mr. Pocket, as a grownup infant with no notion of his own interests, they showed the complacent forbearance I had heard them express. Mrs.
<pb n="91" id="p91b"/>
Pocket they held in contempt; but they allowed the poor soul to have been heavily disappointed in life, because that shed a feeble reflected light upon themselves.</p>
<p>These were the surroundings among which I settled down, and applied myself to my education. I soon contracted expensive habits, and began to spend an amount of money that within a few short months I should have thought almost fabulous; but through good and evil I stuck to my books. There was no other merit in this, than my having sense enough to feel my deficiences. Between Mr. Pocket and Herbert I got on fast; and, with one or the other always at my elbow to give me the start I wanted, and clear obstructions out of my road, I must have been as great a dolt as Drummle if I had done less.</p>
<p>I had not seen Mr. Wemmick for some weeks, when I thought I would write him a note and propose to go home with him on a certain evening. He replied that it would give him much pleasure, and that he would expect me at the office at six o'clock. Thither I went, and there I found him,
<pb n="92" id="p92b"/>
putting the key of his safe down his back as the clock struck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you think of walking down to Walworth?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if you approve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very much,&rdquo; was Wemmick's reply, &ldquo;for I have had my legs under the desk all day, and shall be glad to stretch them. Now, I'll tell you what I have got for supper, Mr. Pip. I have got a stewed steak&mdash;which is of home preparation&mdash;and a cold roast fowl&mdash;which is from the cook's-shop. I think it's tender, because the master of the shop was a Juryman in some cases of ours the other day, and we let him down easy. I reminded him of it when I bought the fowl, and I said, &lsquo;Pick us out a good one, old Briton, because if we had chosen to keep you in the box another day or two, we could easily have done it.&rsquo; He said to that, &lsquo;Let me make you a present of the best fowl in the shop.&rsquo; I let him, of course. As far as it goes, it's property and portable. You don't object to an aged parent, I hope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I really thought he was still speaking of
<pb n="93" id="p93b"/>
the fowl, until he added, &ldquo;Because I have got an aged parent at my place.&rdquo; I then said what politeness required.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, you haven't dined with Mr. Jaggers yet?&rdquo; he pursued, as we walked along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told me so this afternoon when he heard you were coming. I expect you'll have an invitation to-morrow. He's going to ask your pals, too. Three of 'em; ain't there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although I was not in the habit of counting Drummle as one of my intimate associates, I answered, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he's going to ask the whole gang;&rdquo; I hardly felt complimented by the word; &ldquo;and whatever he gives you, he'll give you good. Don't look forward to variety, but you'll have excellence. And there's another rum thing in his house,&rdquo; proceeded Wemmick, after a moment's pause, as if the remark followed on the housekeeper understood; &ldquo;he never lets a door or window be fastened at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he never robbed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's it!&rdquo; returned Wemmick. &ldquo;He
<pb n="94" id="p94b"/>
says, and gives it out publicly, &lsquo;I want to see the man who'll rob <hi rend="italics">me.</hi>&rsquo; Lord bless you, I have heard him, a hundred times if I have heard him once, say to regular cracksmen in our front office, &lsquo;You know where I live; now, no bolt is ever drawn there; why don't you do a stroke of business with me? Come; can't I tempt you?&rsquo; Not a man of them, sir, would be bold enough to try it on, for love or money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They dread him so much?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dread him,&rdquo; said Wemmick. &ldquo;I believe you they dread him. Not but what he's artful, even in his defiance of them. No silver, sir. Britannia metal, every spoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they wouldn't have much,&rdquo; I observed, &ldquo;even if they&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! But <hi rend="italics">he</hi> would have much,&rdquo; said Wemmick, cutting me short, &ldquo;and they know it. He'd have their lives, and the lives of scores of 'em. He'd have all he could get. And it's impossible to say what he couldn't get, if he gave his mind to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was falling into meditation on my
<pb n="95" id="p95b"/>
guardian's greatness, when Wemmick remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to the absence of plate, that's only his natural depth, you know. A river's its natural depth, and he's his natural depth. Look at his watch-chain. That's real enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's very massive,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Massive?&rdquo; repeated Wemmick. &ldquo;I think so. And his watch is a gold repeater, and worth a hundred pound if it's worth a penny. Mr. Pip, there are about seven hundred thieves in this town who know all about that watch; there's not a man, a woman, or a child, among them, who wouldn't identify the smallest link in that chain, and drop it as if it was red-hot, if inveigled into touching it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first with such discourse, and afterwards with conversation of a more general nature, did Mr. Wemmick and I beguile the time and the road, until he gave me to understand that we had arrived in the district of Walworth.</p>
<p>It appeared to be a collection of back
<pb n="96" id="p96b"/>
lanes, ditches, and little gardens, and to present the aspect of a rather dull retirement. Wemmick's house was a little wooden cottage in the midst of plots of garden, and the top of it was cut out and painted like a battery mounted with guns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My own doing,&rdquo; said Wemmick. &ldquo;Looks pretty; don't it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I highly commended it. I think it was the smallest house I ever saw; with the queerest gothic windows (by far the greater part of them sham), and a gothic door, almost too small to get in at.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's a real flagstaff, you see,&rdquo; said Wemmick, &ldquo;and on Sundays I run up a real flag. Then look here. After I have crossed this bridge, I hoist it up&mdash;so&mdash;and cut off the communication.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bridge was a plank, and it crossed a chasm about four feet wide and two deep. But it was very pleasant to see the pride with which he hoisted it up and made it fast; smiling as he did so, with a relish and not merely mechanically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At nine o'clock every night, Greenwich time,&rdquo; said Wemmick, &ldquo;the gun fires. There
<pb n="97" id="p97b"/>
he is, you see! And when you hear him go, I think you'll say he's a Stinger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The piece of ordnance referred to, was mounted in a separate fortress, constructed of lattice-work. It was protected from the weather by an ingenious little tarpaulin contrivance in the nature of an umbrella.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, at the back,&rdquo; said Wemmick, &ldquo;out of sight, so as not to impede the idea of fortifications&mdash;for it's a principle with me, if you have an idea, carry it out and keep it up&mdash;I don't know whether that's your opinion&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said, decidedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the back, there's a pig, and there are fowls and rabbits; then, I knock together my own little frame, you see, and grow cucumbers; and you'll judge at supper what sort of a salad I can raise. So, sir,&rdquo; said Wemmick, smiling again, but seriously too, as he shook his head, &ldquo;if you can suppose the little place besieged, it would hold out a devil of a time in point of provisions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, he conducted me to a bower about a dozen yards off, but which was approached by such ingenious twists of path that it took
<pb n="98" id="p98b"/>
quite a long time to get at; and in this retreat our glasses were already set forth. Our punch was cooling in an ornamental lake, on whose margin the bower was raised. This piece of water (with an island in the middle which might have been the salad for supper) was of a circular form, and he had constructed a fountain in it, which, when you set a little mill going and took a cork out of a pipe, played to that powerful extent that it made the back of your hand quite wet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am my own engineer, and my own carpenter, and my own plumber, and my own gardener, and my own Jack of all Trades,&rdquo; said Wemmick, in acknowledging my compliments. &ldquo;Well; it's a good thing, you know. It brushes the Newgate cobwebs away, and pleases the Aged. You wouldn't mind being at once introduced to the Aged, would you? It wouldn't put you out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I expressed the readiness I felt, and we went into the Castle. There, we found, sitting by a fire, a very old man in a flannel
<pb n="99" id="p99b"/>
coat: clean, cheerful, comfortable, and well cared for, but intensely deaf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well aged parent,&rdquo; said Wemmick, shaking hands with him in a cordial and jocose way, &ldquo;how am you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, John; all right!&rdquo; replied the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here's Mr. Pip, aged parent,&rdquo; said Wemmick, &ldquo;and I wish you could hear his name. Nod away at him, Mr. Pip; that's what he likes. Nod away at him, if you please, like winking!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a fine place of my son's, sir,&rdquo; cried the old man, while I nodded as hard as I possibly could. &ldquo;This is a pretty pleasure-ground, sir. This spot and these beautiful works upon it ought to be kept together by the Nation, after my son's time, for the people's enjoyment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You're as proud of it as Punch; ain't you, Aged?&rdquo; said Wemmick, contemplating the old man, with his hard face really softened; &ldquo;<hi rend="italics">there's</hi> a nod for you;&rdquo; giving him a tremendous one; &ldquo;<hi rend="italics">there's</hi> another for you;&rdquo; giving him a still more tremendous
<pb n="100" id="p100b"/>
one; &ldquo;you like that, don't you? If you're not tired, Mr. Pip&mdash;though I know it's tiring to strangers&mdash;will you tip him one more? You can't think how it pleases him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I tipped him several more, and he was in great spirits. We left him bestirring himself to feed the fowls, and we sat down to our punch in the arbour; where Wemmick told me as he smoked a pipe that it had taken him a good many years to bring the property up to its present pitch of perfection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it your own, Mr. Wemmick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; said Wemmick, &ldquo;I have got hold of it, a bit at a time. It's a freehold, by George!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it, indeed? I hope Mr. Jaggers admires it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never seen it,&rdquo; said Wemmick. &ldquo;Never heard of it. Never seen the Aged. Never heard of him. No; the office is one thing, and private life is another. When I go into the office, I leave the Castle behind me, and when I come into the Castle, I leave the office behind me. If it's not in any way
<pb n="101" id="p101b"/>
disagreeable to you, you'll oblige me by doing the same. I don't wish it professionally spoken about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course I felt my good faith involved in the observance of his request. The punch being very nice, we sat there drinking it and talking, until it was almost nine o'clock. &ldquo;Getting near gun-fire,&rdquo; said Wemmick then, as he laid down his pipe; &ldquo;it's the Aged's treat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Proceeding into the Castle again, we found the Aged heating the poker, with expectant eyes, as a preliminary to the performance of this great nightly ceremony. Wemmick stood with his watch in his hand, until the moment was come for him to take the red-hot poker from the Aged, and repair to the battery. He took it, and went out, and presently the Stinger went off with a Bang that shook the crazy little box of a cottage as if it must fall to pieces, and made every glass and teacup in it ring. Upon this, the Aged&mdash;who I believe would have been blown out of his arm-chair but for holding on by the elbows&mdash;cried out exultingly, &ldquo;He's fired! I heerd him!&rdquo; and I
<pb n="102" id="p102b"/>
nodded at the old gentleman until it is no figure of speech to declare that I absolutely could not see him.</p>
<p>The interval between that time and supper, Wemmick devoted to showing me his collection of curiosities. They were mostly of a felonious character; comprising the pen with which a celebrated forgery had been committed, a distinguished razor or two, some locks of hair, and several manuscript confessions written under condemnation&mdash;upon which Mr. Wemmick set particular value as being, to use his own words, &ldquo;every one of 'em Lies, sir.&rdquo; These were agreeably dispersed among small specimens of china and glass, various neat trifles made by the proprietor of the museum, and some tobacco-stoppers carved by the Aged. They were all displayed in that chamber of the Castle into which I had been first inducted, and which served, not only as the general sitting-room but as the kitchen too, if I might judge from a saucepan on the hob, and a brazen bijou over the fireplace designed for the suspension of a roasting-jack.</p>
<p>There was a neat little girl in attendance,
<pb n="103" id="p103b"/>
who looked after the Aged in the day. When she had laid the supper-cloth, the bridge was lowered to give her means of egress, and she withdrew for the night. The supper was excellent; and though the Castle was rather subject to dry-rot insomuch that it tasted like a bad nut, and though the pig might have been farther off, I was heartily pleased with my whole entertainment. Nor was there any drawback on my little turret bedroom, beyond there being such a very thin ceiling between me and the flagstaff, that when I lay down on my back in bed, it seemed as if I had to balance that pole on my forehead all night.</p>
<p>Wemmick was up early in the morning, and I am afraid I heard him cleaning my boots. After that, he fell to gardening, and I saw him from my gothic window pretending to employ the Aged, and nodding at him in a most devoted manner. Our breakfast was as good as the supper, and at half-past eight precisely we started for Little Britain. By degrees, Wemmick got dryer and harder as we went along, and his mouth tightened into a post-office again.
<pb n="104" id="p104b"/>
At last, when we got to his place of business and he pulled out his key from his coat-collar, he looked as unconscious of his Walworth property as if the Castle and the drawbridge and the arbour and the lake and the fountain and the Aged, had all been blown into space together by the last discharge of the Stinger.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter">
<pb n="105" id="p105b"/>
<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<p>IT fell out as Wemmick had told me it would, that I had an early opportunity of comparing my guardian's establishment with that of his cashier and clerk. My guardian was in his room, washing his hands with his scented soap, when I went into the office from Walworth; and he called me to him, and gave me the invitation for myself and friends which Wemmick had prepared me to receive. &ldquo;No ceremony&rdquo; he stipulated, &ldquo;and no dinner dress, and say to-morrow.&rdquo; I asked him where we should come to (for I had no idea where he lived), and I believe it was in his general objection to make anything like an admission, that he replied,
<pb n="106" id="p106b"/>
&ldquo;Come here, and I'll take you home with me.&rdquo; I embrace this opportunity of remarking that he washed his clients off, as if he were a surgeon or a dentist. He had a closet in his room, fitted up for the purpose, which smelt of the scented soap like a perfumer's shop. It had an unusually large jack-towel on a roller inside the door, and he would wash his hands, and wipe them and dry them all over this towel, whenever he came in from a police-court or dismissed a client from his room. When I and my friends repaired to him at six o'clock next day, he seemed to have been engaged on a case of a darker complexion than usual, for, we found him with his head butted into this closet, not only washing his hands, but laving his face and gargling his throat. And even when he had done all that, and had gone all round the jack-towel, he took out his penknife and scraped the case out of his nails before he put his coat on.</p>
<p>There were some people slinking about as usual when we passed out into the street, who were evidently anxious to speak with him; but there was something so conclusive
<pb n="107" id="p107b"/>
in the halo of scented soap which encircled his presence, that they gave it up for that day. As we walked along westward, he was recognised ever and again by some face in the crowd of the streets, and whenever that happened he talked louder to me; but he never otherwise recognised anybody, or took notice that anybody recognised him.</p>
<p>He conducted us to Gerrard-street, Soho, to a house on the south side of that street. Rather a stately house of its kind, but dolefully in want of painting, and with dirty windows. He took out his key and opened the door, and we all went into a stone hall, bare, gloomy, and little used. So, up a dark brown staircase into a series of three dark brown rooms on the first floor. There were carved garlands on the panelled walls, and as he stood among them giving us welcome, I know what kind of loops I thought they looked like.</p>
<p>Dinner was laid in the best of these rooms; the second was his dressing-room; the third, his bedroom. He told us that he held the whole house, but rarely used more of
<pb n="108" id="p108b"/>
it than we saw. The table was comfortably laid&mdash;no silver in the service, of course&mdash;and at the side of his chair was a capacious dumb-waiter, with a variety of bottles and decanters on it, and four dishes of fruit for dessert. I noticed throughout, that he kept everything under his own hand, and distributed everything himself.</p>
<p>There was a bookcase in the room; I saw, from the backs of the books, that they were about evidence, criminal law, criminal biography, trials, acts of parliament, and such things. The furniture was all very solid and good, like his watch-chain. It had an official look, however, and there was nothing merely ornamental to be seen. In a corner, was a little table of papers with a shaded lamp: so that he seemed to bring the office home with him in that respect too, and to wheel it out of an evening and fall to work.</p>
<p>As he had scarcely seen my three companions until now&mdash;for, he and I had walked together&mdash;he stood on the hearth-rug, after ringing the bell, and took a searching look at them. To my surprise, he seemed at
<pb n="109" id="p109b"/>
once to be principally if not solely interested in Drummle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pip,&rdquo; said he, putting his large hand on my shoulder and moving me to the window, &ldquo;I don't know one from the other. Who's the Spider!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The spider?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The blotchy, sprawly, sulky fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's Bentley Drummle,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;the one with the delicate face is Startop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not making the least account of &ldquo;the one with the delicate face,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;Bentley Drummle is his name, is it? I like the look of that fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He immediately began to talk to Drummle: not at all deterred by his replying in his heavy reticent way, but apparently led on by it to screw discourse out of him. I was looking at the two, when there came between me and them, the housekeeper, with the first dish for the table.</p>
<p>She was a woman of about forty, I supposed&mdash;but I may have thought her younger than she was. Rather tall, of a lithe nimble figure, extremely pale, with large faded eyes, and a quantity of streaming hair. I cannot
<pb n="110" id="p110b"/>
say whether any diseased affection of the heart caused her lips to be parted as if she were panting, and her face to bear a curious expression of suddenness and flutter; but I know that I had been to see Macbeth at the theatre, a night or two before, and that her face looked to me as if it were all disturbed by fiery air, like the faces I had seen rise out of the Witches' caldron.</p>
<p>She set the dish on, touched my guardian quietly on the arm with a finger to notify that dinner was ready, and vanished. We took our seats at the round table, and my guardian kept Drummle on one side of him, while Startop sat on the other. It was a noble dish of fish that the housekeeper had put on table, and we had a joint of equally choice mutton afterwards, and then an equally choice bird. Sauces, wines, all the accessories we wanted, and all of the best, were given out by our host from his dumb-waiter; and when they had made the circuit of the table, he always put them back again. Similarly, he dealt us clean plates and knives and forks, for each course, and
<pb n="111" id="p111b"/>
dropped those just disused into two baskets on the ground by his chair. No other attendant than the housekeeper appeared. She set on every dish; and I always saw in her face, a face rising out of the caldron. Years afterwards, I made a dreadful likeness of that woman, by causing a face that had no other natural resemblance to it than it derived from flowing hair, to pass behind a bowl of flaming spirits in a dark room.</p>
<p>Induced to take particular notice of the housekeeper, both by her own striking appearance and by Wemmick's preparation, I observed that whenever she was in the room, she kept her eyes attentively on my guardian, and that she would remove her hands from any dish she put before him, hesitatingly, as if she dreaded his calling her back, and wanted him to speak when she was nigh, if he had anything to say. I fancied that I could detect in his manner a consciousness of this, and a purpose of always holding her in suspense.</p>
<p>Dinner went off gaily, and, although my guardian seemed to follow rather than originate
<pb n="112" id="p112b"/>
subjects, I knew that he wrenched the weakest part of our dispositions out of us. For myself, I found that I was expressing my tendency to lavish expenditure, and to patronise Herbert, and to boast of my great prospects, before I quite knew that I had opened my lips. It was so with all of us, but with no one more than Drummle: the development of whose inclination to gird in a grudging and suspicious way at the rest, was screwed out of him before the fish was taken off.</p>
<p>It was not then, but when we had got to the cheese, that our conversation turned upon our rowing feats, and that Drummle was rallied for coming up behind of a night in that slow amphibious way of his. Drummle upon this, informed our host that he much preferred our room to our company, and that as to skill he was more than our master, and that as to strength he could scatter us like chaff. By some invisible agency, my guardian wound him up to a pitch little short of ferocity about this trifle; and he fell to baring and spanning his arm to show how muscular it was, and we all fell
<pb n="113" id="p113b"/>
to baring and spanning our arms in a ridiculous manner.</p>
<p>Now, the housekeeper was at that time clearing the table; my guardian, taking no heed of her, but with the side of his face turned from her, was leaning back in his chair biting the side of his forefinger and showing an interest in Drummle, that, to me, was quite inexplicable. Suddenly, he clapped his large hand on the housekeeper's, like a trap, as she stretched it across the table. So suddenly and smartly did he do this, that we all stopped in our foolish contention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you talk of strength,&rdquo; said Mr. Jaggers, &ldquo;<hi rend="italics">I</hi>'ll show you a wrist. Molly, let them see your wrist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her entrapped hand was on the table, but she had already put her other hand behind her waist. &ldquo;Master,&rdquo; she said, in a low voice, with her eyes attentively and entreatingly fixed upon him. &ldquo;Don't!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italics">I</hi>'ll show you a wrist,&rdquo; repeated Mr. Jaggers, with an immovable determination to show it. &ldquo;Molly, let them see your wrist.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="114" id="p114b"/>
<p>&ldquo;Master,&rdquo; she again murmured. &ldquo;Please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Molly,&rdquo; said Mr. Jaggers, not looking at her, but obstinately looking at the opposite side of the room, &ldquo;let them see <hi rend="italics">both</hi> your wrists. Show them. Come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took his hand from hers, and turned that wrist up on the table. She brought her other hand from behind her, and held the two out side by side. The last wrist was much disfigured&mdash;deeply scarred and scarred across and across. When she held her hands out, she took her eyes from Mr. Jaggers, and turned them watchfully on every one of the rest of us in succession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There's power here,&rdquo; said Mr. Jaggers, coolly tracing out the sinews with his forefinger. &ldquo;Very few men have the power of wrist that this woman has. It's remarkable what mere force of grip there is in these hands. I have had occasion to notice many hands; but I never saw stronger in that respect, man's or woman's, than these.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he said these words in a leisurely critical style, she continued to look at every one of us in regular succession as we sat. The moment he ceased, she looked at him
<pb n="115" id="p115b"/>
again. &ldquo;That'll do, Molly,&rdquo; said Mr. Jaggers, giving her a slight nod; &ldquo;you have been admired, and can go.&rdquo; She withdrew her hands and went out of the room, and Mr. Jaggers, putting the decanters on from his dumb-waiter, filled his glass and passed round the wine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At half-past nine, gentlemen,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we must break up. Pray make the best use of your time. I am glad to see you all. Mr. Drummle, I drink to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If his object in singling out Drummle were to bring him out still more, it perfectly succeeded. In a sulky triumph, Drummle showed his morose depreciation of the rest of us, in a more and more offensive degree until he became downright intolerable. Through all his stages, Mr. Jaggers followed him with the same strange interest. He actually seemed to serve as a zest to Mr. Jaggers's wine.</p>
<p>In our boyish want of discretion I dare say we took too much to drink, and I know we talked too much. We became particularly hot upon some boorish sneer of Drummle's, to the effect that we were too free
<pb n="116" id="p116b"/>
with our money. It led to my remarking, with more zeal than discretion, that it came with a bad grace from him, to whom Startop had lent money in my presence but a week or so before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well.&rdquo; retorted Drummle; &ldquo;he'll be paid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't mean to imply that he won't,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but it might make you hold your tongue about us and our money, I should think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italics">You</hi> should think!&rdquo; retorted Drummle. &ldquo;Oh Lord!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say,&rdquo; I went on, meaning to be very severe, &ldquo;that you wouldn't lend money to any of us, if we wanted it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said Drummle. &ldquo;I wouldn't lend one of you a sixpence. I wouldn't lend anybody a sixpence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather mean to borrow under those circumstances, I should say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italics">You</hi> should say,&rdquo; repeated Drummle. &ldquo;Oh Lord!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was so very aggravating&mdash;the more especially as I found myself making no way
<pb n="117" id="p117b"/>
against his surly obtuseness&mdash;that I said, disregarding Herbert's efforts to check me:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Mr. Drummle, since we are on the subject, I'll tell you what passed between Herbert here and me, when you borrowed that money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italics">I</hi> don't want to know what passed between Herbert there and you,&rdquo; growled Drummle. And I think he added in a lower growl, that we might both go to the devil and shake ourselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll tell you, however,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;whether you want to know or not. We said that as you put it in your pocket very glad to get it, you seemed to be immensely amused at his being so weak as to lend it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drummle laughed outright, and sat laughing in our faces, with his hands in his pockets and his round shoulders raised: plainly signifying that it was quite true, and that he despised us, as asses all.</p>
<p>Hereupon Startop took him in hand, though with a much better grace than I had shown, and exhorted him to be a little more agreeable. Startop, being a lively
<pb n="118" id="p118b"/>
bright young fellow, and Drummle being the exact opposite, the latter was always disposed to resent him as a direct personal affront. He now retorted in a coarse lumpish way, and Startop tried to turn the discussion aside with some small pleasantry that made us all laugh. Resenting this little success more than anything, Drummle, without any threat or warning, pulled his hands out of his pockets, dropped his round shoulders, swore, took up a large glass, and would have flung it at his adversary's head, but for our entertainer's dexterously seizing it at the instant when it was raised for that purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said Mr. Jaggers, deliberately putting down the glass, and hauling out his gold repeater by its massive chain, &ldquo;I am exceedingly sorry to announce that it's half-past nine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On this hint we all rose to depart. Before we got to the street door, Startop was cheerily calling Drummle &ldquo;old boy,&rdquo; as if nothing had happened. But the old boy was so far from responding, that he would not even walk to Hammersmith on the same
<pb n="119" id="p119b"/>
side of the way; so, Herbert and I, who remained in town, saw them going down the street on opposite sides; Startop leading, and Drummle lagging behind in the shadow of the houses, much as he was wont to follow in his boat.</p>
<p>As the door was not yet shut, I thought I would leave Herbert there for a moment, and run up-stairs again to say a word to my guardian. I found him in his dressing-room surrounded by his stock of boots, already hard at it, washing his hands of us.</p>
<p>I told him I had come up again, to say how sorry I was that anything disagreeable should have occurred, and that I hoped he would not blame me much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; said he, sluicing his face, and speaking through the water-drops; &ldquo;it's nothing, Pip. I like that Spider though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had turned towards me now, and was shaking his head, and blowing, and towelling himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad you like him, sir,&rdquo; said I&mdash;&ldquo;but I don't.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; my guardian assented; &ldquo;don't have too much to do with him. Keep as
<pb n="120" id="p120b"/>
clear of him as you can. But I like the fellow, Pip; he is one of the true sort. Why, if I was a fortune-teller&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking out of the towel, he caught my eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am not a fortune-teller,&rdquo; he said, letting his head drop into a festoon of towel, and towelling away at his two ears. &ldquo;You know what I am, don't you? Good night, Pip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In about a month after that, the Spider's time with Mr. Pocket was up for good, and, to the great relief of all the house but Mrs. Pocket, he went home to the family hole.</p>

<salute>&ldquo;MY DEAR MR. PIP,</salute>
</opener>
<p>&ldquo;I write this by request of Mr. Gargery, for to let you know that he is going to London in company of Mr. Wopsle and would be glad if agreeable to be allowed to see you. He would call at Barnard's Hotel Tuesday morning 9 o'clock, when if not agreeable please leave word. Your poor sister is much the same as when you left. We talk of you in the kitchen every night, and wonder what you are saying and doing. If now considered in the light of a liberty, excuse it for the love of poor old days. No more, dear Mr. Pip, from</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your ever obliged, and affectionate <lb/> Servant, <lb/> &ldquo;BIDDY.</p>
<p>&ldquo;P.S. He wishes me most particular to write <hi rend="italics">what larks.</hi> He says you will understand. I hope
<pb n="122" id="p122b"/>
and do not doubt it will be agreeable to see him even though a gentleman, for you had ever a good heart and he is a worthy worthy man. I have read him all, excepting only the last little sentence, and he wishes me most particular to write again <hi rend="italics">what larks.</hi>&rdquo;</p>

<p>I received this letter by the post on Monday morning, and therefore its appointment was for next day. Let me confess exactly, with what feelings I looked forward to Joe's coming.</p>
<p>Not with pleasure, though I was bound to him by so many ties; no; with considerable disturbance, some mortification, and a keen sense of incongruity. If I could have kept him away by paying money, I certainly would have paid money. My greatest reassurance was, that he was coming to Barnard's Inn, not to Hammersmith, and consequently would not fall in Bentley Drummle's way. I had little objection to his being seen by Herbert or his father, for both of whom I had a respect; but I had the sharpest sensitiveness as to his being seen by Drummle, whom I held in contempt. So, throughout life, our worst
<pb n="123" id="p123b"/>
weaknesses and meannesses are usually committed for the sake of the people whom we most despise.</p>
<p>I had begun to be always decorating the chambers in some quite unnecessary and inappropriate way or other, and very expensive those wrestles with Barnard proved to be. By this time, the rooms were vastly different from what I had found them, and I enjoyed the honour of occupying a few prominent pages in the books of a neighbouring upholsterer. I had got on so fast of late, that I had even started a boy in boots&mdash;top boots&mdash;in bondage and slavery to whom I might have been said to pass my days. For, after I had made the monster (out of the refuse of my washerwoman's family) and had clothed him with a blue coat, canary waistcoat, white cravat, creamy breeches, and the boots already mentioned, I had to find him a little to do and a great deal to eat; and with both of those horrible requirements he haunted my existence.</p>
<p>This avenging phantom was ordered to be on duty at eight on Tuesday morning in the hall (it was two feet square, as charged for
<pb n="124" id="p124b"/>
floorcloth), and Herbert suggested certain things for breakfast that he thought Joe would like. While I felt sincerely obliged to him for being so interested and considerate, I had an odd half-provoked sense of suspicion upon me, that if Joe had been coming to see <hi rend="italics">him,</hi> he wouldn't have been quite so brisk about it.</p>
<p>However, I came into town on the Monday night to be ready for Joe, and I got up early in the morning, and caused the sitting-room and breakfast-table to assume their most splendid appearance. Unfortunately the morning was drizzly, and an angel could not have concealed the fact that Barnard was shedding sooty tears outside the window, like some weak giant of a Sweep.</p>
<p>As the time approached I should have liked to run away, but the Avenger pursuant to orders was in the hall, and presently I heard Joe on the staircase. I knew it was Joe, by his clumsy manner of coming up-stairs&mdash;his state boots being always too big for him&mdash;and by the time it took him to read the names on the other floors in the course of his ascent. When at last he
<pb n="125" id="p125b"/>
stopped outside our door, I could hear his finger tracing over the painted letters of my name, and I afterwards distinctly heard him breathing in at the keyhole. Finally he gave a faint single rap, and Pepper&mdash;such was the compromising name of the avenging boy&mdash;announced &ldquo;Mr. Gargery!&rdquo; I thought he never would have done wiping his feet, and that I must have gone out to lift him off the mat, but at last he came in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe, how are you, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pip, how AIR you, Pip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With his good honest face all glowing and shining, and his hat put down on the floor between us, he caught both my hands and worked them straight up and down, as if I had been the last-patented Pump.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to see you, Joe. Give me your hat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Joe, taking it up carefully with both hands, like a bird's-nest with eggs in it, wouldn't hear of parting with that piece of property, and persisted in standing talking over it in a most uncomfortable way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which you have that growed,&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;and that swelled, and that gentlefolked;&rdquo;
<pb n="126" id="p126b"/>
Joe considered a little before he discovered this word; &ldquo;as to be sure you are a honour to your king and country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, Joe, look wonderfully well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God,&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;I'm ekerval to most. And your sister, she's no worse than she were. And Biddy, she's ever right and ready. And all friends is no backerder, if not no forarder. 'Ceptin' Wopsle; he's had a drop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this time (still with both hands taking great care of the bird's-nest), Joe was rolling his eyes round and round the room, and round and round the flowered pattern of my dressing-gown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had a drop, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why yes,&rdquo; said Joe, lowering his voice, &ldquo;he's left the Church, and went into the playacting. Which the playacting have likeways brought him to London along with me. And his wish were,&rdquo; said Joe, getting the bird's-nest under his left arm for the moment and groping in it for an egg with his right; &ldquo;if no offence, as I would 'and you that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I took what Joe gave me, and found it
<pb n="127" id="p127b"/>
to be the crumpled playbill of a small metropolitan theatre, announcing the first appearance, in that very week, of &ldquo;the celebrated Provincial Amateur of Roscian renown, whose unique performance in the highest tragic walk of our National Bard has lately occasioned so great a sensation in local dramatic circles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you at his performance, Joe?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <hi rend="italics">were,</hi>&rdquo; said Joe, with emphasis and solemnity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was there a great sensation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;yes, there certainly were a peck of orange-peel. Partickler, when he see the ghost. Though I put it to yourself, sir, whether it were calc'lated to keep a man up to his work with a good hart, to be continiwally cutting in betwixt him and the Ghost with &lsquo;Amen!&rsquo; A man may have had a misfortun' and been in the Church,&rdquo; said Joe, lowering his voice to an argumentative and feeling tone, &ldquo;but that is no reason why you should put him out at such a time. Which I meantersay, if the ghost of a man's own father cannot be
<pb n="128" id="p128b"/>
allowed to claim his attention, what can, Sir? Still more, when his mourning 'at is unfortunately made so small as that the weight of the black feathers brings it off, try to keep it on how you may.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A ghost-seeing effect in Joe's own countenance informed me that Herbert had entered the room. So, I presented Joe to Herbert, who held out his hand; but Joe backed from it, and held on by the bird's-nest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your servant, Sir,&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;which I hope as you and Pip&rdquo;&mdash;here his eye fell on the Avenger, who was putting some toast on table, and so plainly denoted an intention to make that young gentleman one of the family, that I frowned it down and confused him more&mdash;&ldquo;I meantersay, you two gentlemen&mdash;which I hope as you get your elths in this close spot? For the present may be a werry good inn, according to London opinions,&rdquo; said Joe, confidentially, &ldquo;and I believe its character do <sic corr="[?]">stand i</sic>; but I wouldn't keep a pig in it myself&mdash;not in the case that I wished him to fatten
<pb n="129" id="p129b"/>
wholesome and to eat with a meller flavour on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having borne this flattering testimony to the merits of our dwelling-place, and having incidentally shown this tendency to call me &ldquo;sir,&rdquo; Joe, being invited to sit down to table, looked all round the room for a suitable spot on which to deposit his hat&mdash;as if it were only on some very few rare substances in nature that it could find a resting-place&mdash;and ultimately stood it on an extreme corner of the chimney-piece, from which it ever afterwards fell off at intervals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you take tea, or coffee, Mr. Gargery?&rdquo; asked Herbert, who always presided of a morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thankee, Sir,&rdquo; said Joe, stiff from head to foot, &ldquo;I'll take whichever is most agreeable to yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say to coffee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thankee, Sir,&rdquo; returned Joe, evidently dispirited by the proposal, &ldquo;since you <hi rend="italics">are</hi> so kind as make chice of coffee, I will not run contrairy to your own opinions. But don't you never find it a little 'eating?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="130" id="p130b"/>
<p>&ldquo;Say tea then,&rdquo; said Herbert, pouring it out.</p>
<p>Here Joe's hat tumbled off the mantelpiece, and he started out of his chair and picked it up, and fitted it to the same exact spot. As if it were an absolute point of good breeding that it should tumble off again soon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did you come to town, Mr. Gargery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were it yesterday afternoon?&rdquo; said Joe, after coughing behind his hand, as if he had had time to catch the whooping-cough since he came. &ldquo;No it were not. Yes it were. Yes. It were yesterday afternoon&rdquo; (with an appearance of mingled wisdom, relief, and strict impartiality).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen anything of London, yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, Sir,&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;me and Wopsle went off straight to look at the Blacking Ware'us. But we didn't find that it come up to its likeness in the red bills at the shop doors; which I meantersay,&rdquo; added Joe, in an explanatory manner, &ldquo;as it is there drawd too architectooralooral.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="131" id="p131b"/>
<p>I really believe Joe would have prolonged this word (mightily expressive to my mind of some architecture that I know) into a perfect Chorus, but for his attention being providentially attracted by his hat, which was toppling. Indeed, it demanded from him a constant attention, and a quickness of eye and hand, very like that exacted by wicket-keeping. He made extraordinary play with it, and showed the greatest skill; now, rushing at it and catching it neatly as it dropped; now, merely stopping it midway, beating it up, and humouring it in various parts of the room and against a good deal of the pattern of the paper on the wall, before he felt it safe to close with it; finally, splashing it into the slop-basin, where I took the liberty of laying hands upon it.</p>
<p>As to his shirt-collar, and his coat-collar, they were perplexing to reflect upon&mdash;insoluble mysteries both. Why should a man scrape himself to that extent, before he could consider himself full dressed? Why should he suppose it necessary to be purified by suffering for his holiday clothes? Then he fell into such unaccountable fits of
<pb n="132" id="p132b"/>
meditation, with his fork midway between his plate and his mouth; had his eyes attracted in such strange directions; was afflicted with such remarkable coughs; sat so far from the table, and dropped so much more than he ate, and pretended that he hadn't dropped it; that I was heartily glad when Herbert left us for the City.</p>
<p>I had neither the good sense nor the good feeling to know that this was all my fault, and that if I had been easier with Joe, Joe would have been easier with me. I felt impatient of him and out of temper with him; in which condition he heaped coals of fire on my head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Us two being now alone, Sir,&rdquo;&mdash;began Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe,&rdquo; I interrupted, pettishly, &ldquo;how can you call me, Sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe looked at me for a single instant with something faintly like reproach. Utterly preposterous as his cravat was, and as his collars were, I was conscious of a sort of dignity in the look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Us two being now alone,&rdquo; resumed Joe, &ldquo;and me having the intentions and abilities

to stay not many minutes more, I will now conclude&mdash;leastways begin&mdash;to mention what have led to my having had the present honour. For was it not,&rdquo; said Joe, with his old air of lucid exposition, &ldquo;that my only wish were to be useful to you, I should not have had the honour of breaking wittles in the company and abode of gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was so unwilling to see the look again, that I made no remonstrance against this tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Sir,&rdquo; pursued Joe, &ldquo;this is how it were. I were at the Bargemen t'other night, Pip;&rdquo; whenever he subsided into affection, he called me Pip, and whenever he relapsed into politeness he called me Sir; &ldquo;when there come up in his shay-cart, Pumblechook. Which that same identical,&rdquo; said Joe, going down a new track, &ldquo;do comb my 'air the wrong way sometimes, awful, by giving out up and down town as it were him which ever had your infant companionation and were looked upon as a playfellow by yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense. It was you, Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="134" id="p134b"/>
<p>&ldquo;Which I fully believed it were, Pip,&rdquo; said Joe, slightly tossing his head, &ldquo;though it signify little now, Sir. Well, Pip; this same identical, which his manners is given to blusterous, come to me at the Bargemen (wot a pipe and a pint of beer do give refreshment to the working-man, Sir, and do not over stimilate), and his word were, &lsquo;Joseph, Miss Havisham she wish to speak to you.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Havisham, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo; &lsquo;She wish,&rsquo; were Pumblechook's word, &lsquo;to speak to you.&rsquo; &rdquo; Joe sat and rolled his eyes at the ceiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Joe? Go on, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next day, Sir,&rdquo; said Joe, looking at me as if I were a long way off, &ldquo;having cleaned myself, I go and I see Miss A.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss A., Joe? Miss Havisham?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which I say, Sir,&rdquo; replied Joe, with an air of legal formality, as if he were making his will, &ldquo;Miss A., or otherways Havisham. Her expression air then as follering: &lsquo;Mr. Gargery. You air in correspondence with Mr. Pip?&rsquo; Having had a
<pb n="135" id="p135b"/>
letter from you, I were able to say &lsquo;I am.&rsquo; (when I married 
your sister, Sir, I said &lsquo;I will;&rsquo; and  when I answered your  
friend, Pip, I said &lsquo;I am.&rsquo;)  &lsquo;Would you tell him, 
then,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;that which Estella has come home and would 
be glad to see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt my face fire up as I looked at Joe. I hope one remote cause of its firing, may have been my consciousness that if I had known his errand, I should have given him more encouragement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Biddy,&rdquo; pursued Joe, &ldquo;when I got home and asked her fur to write the message to you, a little hung back. Biddy says, &lsquo;I know he will be very glad to have it by word of mouth, it is holiday-time, you want to see him, go!&rsquo; I have now concluded, Sir,&rdquo; said Joe, rising from his chair, &ldquo;and, Pip, I wish you ever well and ever prospering to a greater and a greater heighth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are not going now, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes I am,&rdquo; said Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are coming back to dinner, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No I am not,&rdquo; said Joe.</p>
<pb n="136" id="p136b"/>
<p>Our eyes met, and all the &ldquo;Sir&rdquo; melted out of that manly heart as he gave me his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pip, dear old chap, life is made of ever so many partings welded together, as I may say, and one man's a blacksmith, and one's a whitesmith, and one's a goldsmith, and one's a coppersmith. Diwisions among such must come, and must be met as they come. If there's been any fault at all to-day, it's mine. You and me is not two figures to be together in London; nor yet anywheres else but what is private, and beknown, and understood among friends. It ain't that I am proud, but that I want to be right, as you shall never see me no more in these clothes. I'm wrong in these clothes. I'm wrong out of the forge, the kitchen, or off th' meshes. You won't find half so much fault in me if you think of me in my forge dress, with my hammer in my hand, or even my pipe. You won't find half so much fault in me if, supposing as you should ever wish to see me, you come and put your head in at the forge window and see Joe the blacksmith, there, at the old anvil, in
<pb n="137" id="p137b"/>
the old burnt apron, sticking to the old work. I'm awful dull, but I hope I've beat out something nigh the rights of this at last. And so GOD bless you, dear old Pip, old chap, GOD bless you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had not been mistaken in my fancy that there was a simple dignity in him. The fashion of his dress could no more come in its way when he spoke these words, than it could come in its way in Heaven. He touched me gently on the forehead, and went out. As soon as I could recover myself sufficiently, I hurried out after him and looked for him in the neighbouring streets; but he was gone.</p>
</div2>

<head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
<p>IT was clear that I must repair to our town next day, and in the first flow of my repentance it was equally clear that I must stay at Joe's. But, when I had secured my box-place by to-morrow's coach and had been down to Mr. Pocket's and back, I was not by any means convinced on the last point, and began to invent reasons and make excuses for putting up at the Blue Boar. I should be an inconvenience at Joe's; I was not expected, and my bed would not be ready; I should be too far from Miss Havisham's, and she was exacting and mightn't like it. All other swindlers upon earth are nothing to the self-swindlers, and with such
<pb n="139" id="p139b"/>
pretences did I cheat myself. Surely a curious thing. That I should innocently take a bad half-crown of somebody else's manufacture, is reasonable enough; but that I should knowingly reckon the spurious coin of my own make, as good money! An obliging stranger, under pretence of compactly folding up my bank-notes for security's sake, abstracts the notes and gives me nutshells; but what is his sleight of hand to mine, when I fold up my own nutshells and pass them on myself as notes!</p>
<p>Having settled that I must go to the Blue Boar, my mind was much disturbed by indecision whether or no to take the Avenger. It was tempting to think of that expensive Mercenary publicly airing his boots in the archway of the Blue Boar's posting-yard; it was almost solemn to imagine him casually produced in the tailor's shop and confounding the disrespectful senses of Trabb's boy. On the other hand, Trabb's boy might worm himself into his intimacy and tell him things; or, reckless and desperate wretch as I knew he could be, might hoot him in the High-street. My patroness, too, might hear of
<pb n="140" id="p140b"/>
him, and not approve. On the whole, I resolved to leave the Avenger behind.</p>
<p>It was the afternoon coach by which I had taken my place, and, as winter had now come round, I should not arrive at my destination until two or three hours after dark. Our time of starting from the Cross Keys was two o'clock. I arrived on the ground with a quarter of an hour to spare, attended by the Avenger&mdash;if I may connect that expression with one who never attended on me if he could possibly help it.</p>
<p>At that time it was customary to carry Convicts down to the dockyards by stagecoach. As I had often heard of them in the capacity of outside passengers, and had more than once seen them on the high road dangling their ironed legs over the coach roof, I had no cause to be surprised when Herbert, meeting me in the yard, came up and told me there were two convicts going down with me. But I had a reason that was an old reason now, for constitutionally faltering whenever I heard the word convict.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don't mind them, Handel?&rdquo; said Herbert.</p>
<pb n="141" id="p141b"/>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you seemed as if you didn't like them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can't pretend that I do like them, and I suppose you don't particularly. But I don't mind them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See! There they are,&rdquo; said Herbert, &ldquo;coming out of the Tap. What a degraded and vile sight it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had been treating their guard, I suppose, for they had a gaoler with them, and all three came out wiping their mouths on their hands. The two convicts were handcuffed together, and had irons on their legs&mdash;irons of a pattern that I knew well. They wore the dress that I likewise knew well. Their keeper had a brace of pistols, and carried a thick-knobbed bludgeon under his arm; but he was on terms of good understanding with them, and stood, with them beside him, looking on at the putting-to of the horses, rather with an air as if the convicts were an interesting Exhibition not formally open at the moment, and he the Curator. One was a taller and stouter man than the other, and appeared as a matter of course,
<pb n="142" id="p142b"/>
according to the mysterious ways of the world both convict and free, to have had allotted to him the smaller suit of clothes. His arms and legs were like great pincushions of those shapes, and his attire disguised him absurdly; but I knew his half-closed eye at one glance. There stood the man whom I had seen on the settle at the Three Jolly Bargemen on a Saturday night, and who had brought me down with his invisible gun!</p>
<p>It was easy to make sure that as yet he knew me no more than if he had never seen me in his life. He looked across at me, and his eye appraised my watch-chain, and then he incidentally spat and said something to the other convict, and they laughed and slued themselves round with a clink of their coupling manacle, and looked at something else. The great numbers on their backs, as if they were street doors; their coarse mangy ungainly outer surface, as if they were lower animals; their ironed legs, apologetically garlanded with pocket-handkerchiefs; and the way in which all present looked at them and kept from them; made
<pb n="143" id="p143b"/>
them (as Herbert had said) a most disagreeable and degraded spectacle.</p>
<p>But this was not the worst of it. It came out that the whole of the back of the coach had been taken by a family removing from London, and that there were no places for the two prisoners but on the seat in front, behind the coachman. Hereupon, a choleric gentleman, who had taken the fourth place on that seat, flew into a most violent passion, and said that it was a breach of contract to mix him up with such <sic corr="villainous">villanous</sic> company, and that it was poisonous and pernicious and infamous and shameful, and I don't know what else. At this time the coach was ready and the coachman impatient, and we were all preparing to get up, and the prisoners had come over with their keeper&mdash;bringing with them that curious flavour of bread-poultice, baize, rope-yarn, and hearthstone, which attends the convict presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't take it so much amiss, sir,&rdquo; pleaded the keeper to the angry passenger; &ldquo;I'll sit next you myself. I'll put 'em on the outside of the row. They won't interfere with you, sir. You needn't know they're there.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="144" id="p144b"/>
<p>&ldquo;And don't blame <hi rend="italics">me,</hi>&rdquo; growled the convict I had recognised. &ldquo;<hi rend="italics">I</hi> don't want to go. <hi rend="italics">I</hi> am quite ready to stay behind. As fur as I am concerned any one's welcome to <hi rend="italics">my</hi> place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or, mine,&rdquo; said the other, gruffly. &ldquo;<hi rend="italics">I</hi> wouldn't have incommoded none of you, if I'd a had <hi rend="italics">my</hi> way.&rdquo; Then, they both laughed, and began cracking nuts, and spitting the shells about.&mdash;As I really think I should have liked to do myself, if I had been in their place and so despised.</p>
<p>At length, it was voted that there was no help for the angry gentleman, and that he must either go in his chance company or remain behind. So, he got into his place, still making complaints, and the keeper got into the place next him, and the convicts hauled themselves up as well as they could, and the convict I had recognised sat behind me with his breath on the hair of my head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by, Handel!&rdquo; Herbert called out as we started. I thought what a blessed fortune it was, that he had found another name for me than Pip.</p>
<p>It is impossible to express with what
<pb n="145" id="p145b"/>
acuteness I felt the convict's breathing, not only on the back of my head, but all along my spine. The sensation was like being touched in the marrow with some pungent and searching acid, and it set my very teeth on edge. He seemed to have more breathing business to do than another man, and to make more noise in doing it; and I was conscious of growing high-shouldered on one side, in my shrinking endeavours to fend him off.</p>
<p>The weather was miserably raw, and the two cursed the cold. It made us all lethargic before we had gone far, and when we had left the Half-way House behind, we habitually dozed and shivered and were silent. I dozed off, myself, in considering the question whether I ought to restore a couple of pounds sterling to this creature before losing sight of him, and how it could best be done. In the act of dipping forward as if I were going to bathe among the horses, I woke in a fright and took the question up again.</p>
<p>But I must have lost it longer than I had thought, since, although I could recognise nothing in the darkness and the fitful lights
<pb n="146" id="p146b"/>
and shadows of our lamps, I traced marsh country in the cold damp wind that blew at us. Cowering forward for warmth and to make me a screen against the wind, the convicts were closer to me than before. The very first words I heard them interchange as I became conscious were the words of my own thought, &ldquo;Two One Pound notes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did he get 'em?&rdquo; said the convict I had never seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should I know?&rdquo; returned the other. &ldquo;He had 'em stowed away somehows. Giv him by friends, I expect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; said the other, with a bitter curse upon the cold, &ldquo;that I had 'em here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two one pound notes, or friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two one pound notes. I'd sell all the friends I ever had, for one, and think it a blessed good bargain. Well? So he says&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he says,&rdquo; resumed the convict I had recognised&mdash;&ldquo;it was all said and done in half a minute, behind a pile of timber in the Dockyard&mdash;&lsquo;You're a going to be discharged?&rsquo; Yes, I was. Would I find out
<pb n="147" id="p147b"/>
that boy that had fed him and kep his secret, and give him them two one pound notes? Yes, I would. And I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More fool you,&rdquo; growled the other. I'd have spent 'em on a Man, in wittles and drink. He must have been a green one. Mean to say he knowed nothing of you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a ha'porth. Different gangs and different ships. He was tried again for prison breaking, and got made a Lifer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And was that&mdash;Honour!&mdash;the only time you worked out, in this part of the country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What might have been your opinion of the place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A most beastly place. Mudbank, mist, swamp, and work; work, swamp, mist, and mudbank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They both execrated the place in very strong language, and gradually growled themselves out, and had nothing left to say.</p>
<p>After overhearing this dialogue, I should assuredly have got down and been left in the solitude and darkness of the highway, but for feeling certain that the man had no
<pb n="148" id="p148b"/>
suspicion of my identity. Indeed, I was not only so changed in the course of nature, but so differently dressed and so differently circumstanced, that it was not at all likely he could have known me without accidental help. Still, the coincidence of our being together on the coach, was sufficiently strange to fill me with a dread that some other coincidence might at any moment connect me, in his hearing, with my name. For this reason, I resolved to alight as soon as we touched the town, and put myself out of his hearing. This device I executed successfully. My little portmanteau was in the boot under my feet; I had but to turn a hinge to get it out; I threw it down before me, got down after it, and was left at the first lamp on the first stones of the town pavement. As to the convicts, they went their way with the coach, and I knew at what point they would be spirited off to the river. In my fancy, I saw the boat with its convict crew waiting for them at the slime-washed stairs,&mdash;again heard the gruff &ldquo;Give way, you!&rdquo; like an order to dogs&mdash;again saw the
<pb n="149" id="p149b"/>
wicked Noah's Ark lying out on the black water.</p>
<p>I could not have said what I was afraid of, for my fear was altogether undefined and vague, but there was great fear upon me. As I walked on to the hotel, I felt that a dread, much exceeding the mere apprehension of a painful or disagreeable recognition, made me tremble. I am confident that it took no distinctness of shape, and that it was the revival for a few minutes of the terror of childhood.</p>
<p>The coffee-room at the Blue Boar was empty, and I had not only ordered my dinner there, but had sat down to it, before the waiter knew me. As soon as he had apologised for the remissness of his memory, he asked me if he should send Boots for Mr. Pumblechook?</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;certainly not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The waiter (it was he who had brought up the Great Remonstrance from the Commercials, on the day when I was bound) appeared surprised, and took the earliest opportunity of putting a dirty old copy of
<pb n="150" id="p150b"/>
a local newspaper so directly in my way, that I took it up and read this paragraph:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our readers will learn, not altogether without interest, in reference to the recent romantic rise in fortune of a young artificer in iron of this neighbourhood (what a theme, by the way, for the magic pen of our as yet not universally acknowledged townsman TOOBY, the poet of our columns!) that the youth's earliest patron, companion, and friend, was a highly-respected individual not entirely unconnected with the corn and seed trade, and whose eminently convenient and commodious business premises are situate within a hundred miles of the High-street. It is not wholly irrespective of our personal feelings that we record HIM as the Mentor of our young Telemachus, for it is good to know that our town produced the founder of the latter's fortunes. Does the thought-contracted brow of the local Sage or the lustrous eye of local Beauty inquire whose fortunes? We believe that Quintin Matsys was the BLACKSMITH of Antwerp. VERB. SAP.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="151" id="p151b"/>
<p>I entertain a conviction, based upon large experience, that if in the days of my prosperity I had gone to the North Pole, I should have met somebody there, wandering Esquimaux or civilised man, who would have told me that Pumblechook was my earliest patron and the founder of my fortunes.</p>

<head>CHAPTER X.</head>
<p>BETIMES in the morning I was up and out. It was too early yet to go to Miss Havisham's, so I loitered into the country on Miss Havisham's side of town&mdash;which was not Joe's side; I could go there to-morrow&mdash;thinking about my patroness, and painting brilliant pictures of her plans for me.</p>
<p>She had adopted Estella, she had as good as adopted me, and it could not fail to be her intention to bring us together. She reserved it for me to restore the desolate house, admit the sunshine into the dark rooms, set the clocks a going and the cold hearths a blazing, tear down the cobwebs, destroy the vermin&mdash;in short, do all the
<pb n="153" id="p153b"/>
shining deeds of the young Knight of romance, and marry the Princess. I had stopped to look at the house as I passed; and its seared red brick walls, blocked windows, and strong green ivy clasping even the stacks of chimneys with its twigs and tendons, as if with sinewy old arms, had made up a rich attractive mystery, of which I was the hero. Estella was the inspiration of it, and the heart of it, of course. But, though she had taken such strong possession of me, though my fancy and my hope were so set upon her, though her influence on my boyish life and character had been all-powerful, I did not, even that romantic morning, invest her with any attributes save those she possessed. I mention this in this place, of a fixed purpose, because it is the clue by which I am to be followed into my poor labyrinth. According to my experience, the conventional notion of a lover cannot be always true. The unqualified truth is, that when I loved Estella with the love of a man, I loved her simply because I found her irresistible. Once for all; I knew to my sorrow, often and often, if not always, that
<pb n="154" id="p154b"/>
I loved her against reason, against promise, against peace, against hope, against happiness, against all discouragement that could be. Once for all; I loved her none the less because I knew it, and it had no more influence in restraining me, than if I had devoutly believed her to be human perfection.</p>
<p>I so shaped out my walk as to arrive at the gate at my old time. When I had rung at the bell with an unsteady hand, I turned my back upon the gate, while I tried to get my breath and keep the beating of my heart moderately quiet. I heard the side door open, and steps come across the court-yard; but I pretended not to hear, even when the gate swung on its rusty hinges.</p>
<p>Being at last touched on the shoulder, I started and turned. I started much more naturally then, to find myself confronted by a man in a sober grey dress. The last man I should have expected to see in that place of porter at Miss Havisham's door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Orlick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, young master, there's more changes than yours. But come in, come in. It's
<pb n="155" id="p155b"/>
opposed to my orders to hold the gate open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I entered and he swung it, and locked it, and took the key out. &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said he, facing round, after doggedly preceding me a few steps towards the house. &ldquo;Here I am!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you come here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I come here,&rdquo; he retorted, &ldquo;on my legs. I had my box brought alongside me in a barrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you here for good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain't here for harm, young master, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was not so sure of that. I had leisure to entertain the retort in my mind, while he slowly lifted his heavy glance from the pavement, up my legs and arms, to my face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you have left the forge?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do this look like a forge?&rdquo; replied Orlick, sending his glance all round him with an air of injury. &ldquo;Now, do it look like it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I asked him how long he had left Gargery's forge?</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day is so like another here,&rdquo; he
<pb n="156" id="p156b"/>
replied, &ldquo;that I don't know without casting it up. However, I come here some time since you left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could have told you that, Orlick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said he, dryly. &ldquo;But then you've got to be a scholar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time we had come to the house, where I found his room to be one just within the side door, with a little window in it looking on the court-yard. In its small proportions, it was not unlike the kind of place usually assigned to a gate-porter in Paris. Certain keys were hanging on the wall, to which he now added the gate key; and his patchwork-covered bed was in a little inner division or recess. The whole had a slovenly confined and sleepy look, like a cage for a human dormouse: while he, looming dark and heavy in the shadow of a corner by the window, looked like the human dormouse for whom it was fitted up&mdash;as indeed he was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw this room before,&rdquo; I remarked; &ldquo;but there used to be no Porter here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;not till it got about that
<pb n="157" id="p157b"/>
there was no protection on the premises, and it come to be considered dangerous, with convicts and Tag and Rag and Bobtail going up and down. And then I was recommended to the place as a man who could give another man as good as he brought, and I took it. It's easier than bellowsing and hammering.&mdash;That's loaded, that is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My eye had been caught by a gun with a brass-bound stock over the chimney-piece, and his eye had followed mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, not desirous of more conversation, &ldquo;shall I go up to Miss Havisham?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burn me, if I know!&rdquo; he retorted, first stretching himself and then shaking himself; &ldquo;my orders ends here, young master. I give this here bell a rap with this here hammer, and you go on along the passage till you meet somebody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am expected, I believe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burn me twice over, if I can say!&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>Upon that, I turned down the long passage which I had first trodden in my thick
<pb n="158" id="p158b"/>
boots, and he made his bell sound. At the end of the passage, while the bell was still reverberating, I found Sarah Pocket: who appeared to have now become constitutionally green and yellow by reason of me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;You, is it, Mr. Pip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, Miss Pocket. I am glad to tell you that Mr. Pocket and family are all well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they any wiser?&rdquo; said Sarah, with a dismal shake of the head; &ldquo;they had better be wiser, than well. Ah, Matthew, Matthew! You know your way, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tolerably, for I had gone up the staircase in the dark, many a time. I ascended it now, in lighter boots than of yore, and tapped in my old way at the door of Miss Havisham's room. &ldquo;Pip's rap,&rdquo; I heard her say, immediately; &ldquo;come in, Pip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was in her chair near the old table, in the old dress, with her two hands crossed on her stick, her chin resting on them, and her eyes on the fire. Sitting near her, with the white shoe that had never been worn, in her hand, and her head bent as she looked
<pb n="159" id="p159b"/>
at it, was an elegant lady whom I had never seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, Pip,&rdquo; Miss Havisham continued to mutter, without looking round or up; &ldquo;come in, Pip, how do you do, Pip? so you kiss my hand as if I were a queen, eh?&mdash;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked up at me suddenly, only moving her eyes, and repeated in a grimly playful manner,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard, Miss Havisham,&rdquo; said I, rather at a loss, &ldquo;that you were so kind as to wish me to come and see you, and I came directly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady whom I had never seen before, lifted up her eyes and looked archly at me, and then I saw that the eyes were Estella's eyes. But she was so much changed, was so much more beautiful, so much more womanly, in all things winning admiration had made such wonderful advance, that I seemed to have made none. I fancied, as I looked at her, that I slipped hopelessly back
<pb n="160" id="p160b"/>
into the coarse and common boy again. O the sense of distance and disparity that came upon me, and the inaccessibility that came about her!</p>
<p>She gave me her hand. I stammered something about the pleasure I felt in seeing her again, and about my having looked forward to it for a long, long time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you find her much changed, Pip?&rdquo; asked Miss Havisham, with her greedy look, and striking her stick upon a chair that stood between them, as a sign to me to sit down there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I came in, Miss Havisham, I thought there was nothing of Estella in the face or figure; but now it all settles down so curiously into the old&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? You are not going to say into the old Estella?&rdquo; Miss Havisham interrupted. &ldquo;She was proud and insulting, and you wanted to go away from her. Don't you remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said confusedly that that was long ago, and that I knew no better then, and the like. Estella smiled with perfect composure, and said she had no doubt of my having
<pb n="161" id="p161b"/>
been quite right, and of her having been very disagreeable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is <hi rend="italics">he</hi> changed?&rdquo; Miss Havisham asked her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very much,&rdquo; said Estella, looking at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Less coarse and common?&rdquo; said Miss Havisham, playing with Estella's hair.</p>
<p>Estella laughed, and looked at the shoe in her hand, and laughed again, and looked at me, and put the shoe down. She treated me as a boy still, but she lured me on.</p>
<p>We sat in the dreamy room among the old strange influences which had so wrought upon me, and I learnt that she had but just come home from France, and that she was going to London. Proud and wilful as of old, she had brought those qualities into such subjection to her beauty that it was impossible and out of nature&mdash;or I thought so&mdash;to separate them from her beauty. Truly it was impossible to dissociate her presence from all those wretched hankerings after money and gentility that had disturbed my boyhood&mdash;from all those ill-regulated aspirations that had first made me ashamed of home and Joe&mdash;from all those visions
<pb n="162" id="p162b"/>
that had raised her face in the glowing fire, struck it out of the iron on the anvil, extracted it from the darkness of night to look in at the wooden window of the forge and flit away. In a word, it was impossible for me to separate her, in the past or in the present, from the innermost life of my life.</p>
<p>It was settled that I should stay there all the rest of the day, and return to the hotel at night, and to London to-morrow. When we had conversed for a while, Miss Havisham sent us two out to walk in the neglected garden: on our coming in by-and-by, she said, I should wheel her about a little as in times of yore.</p>
<p>So, Estella and I went out into the garden by the gate through which I had strayed to my encounter with the pale young gentleman, now Herbert; I, trembling in spirit and worshipping the very hem of their dress; she, quite composed and most decidedly not worshipping the hem of mine. As we drew near to the place of encounter, she stopped and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must have been a singular little creature
<pb n="163" id="p163b"/>
to hide and see that fight that day: but I did, and I enjoyed it very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You rewarded me very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I?&rdquo; she replied, in an incidental and forgetful way. &ldquo;I remember I entertained a great objection to your adversary, because I took it ill that he should be brought here to pester me with his company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He and I are great friends now,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you? I think I recollect though, that you read with his father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I made the admission with reluctance, for it seemed to have a boyish look, and she already treated me more than enough like a boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since your change of fortune and prospects, you have changed your companions,&rdquo; said Estella.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And necessarily,&rdquo; she added, in a haughty tone; &ldquo;what was fit company for you once, would be quite unfit company for you now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In my conscience, I doubt very much
<pb n="164" id="p164b"/>
whether I had any lingering intention left, of going to see Joe; but if I had, this observation put it to flight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had no idea of your impending good fortune, in those times?&rdquo; said Estella, with a slight wave of her hand, signifying in the fighting times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The air of completeness and superiority with which she walked at my side, and the air of youthfulness and submission with which I walked at hers, made a contrast that I strongly felt. It would have rankled in me more than it did, if I had not regarded myself as eliciting it by being so set apart for her and assigned to her.</p>
<p>The garden was too overgrown and rank for walking in with ease, and after we had made the round of it twice or thrice, we came out again into the brewery yard. I showed her to a nicety where I had seen her walking on the casks, that first old day, and she said, with a cold and careless look in that direction, &ldquo;Did I?&rdquo; I reminded her where she had come out of the house and given me my meat and drink, and she said,
<pb n="165" id="p165b"/>
&ldquo;I don't remember.&rdquo; &ldquo;Not remember that you made me cry?&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said she, and shook her head and looked about her. I verily believe that her not remembering and not minding in the least, made me cry again, inwardly&mdash;and that is the sharpest crying of all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must know,&rdquo; said Estella, condescending to me as a brilliant and beautiful woman might, &ldquo;that I have no heart&mdash;if that has anything to do with my memory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I got through some jargon to the effect that I took the liberty of doubting that. That I knew better. That there could be no such beauty without it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I have a heart to be stabbed in or shot in, I have no doubt,&rdquo; said Estella, &ldquo;and, of course, if it ceased to beat I should cease to be. But you know what I mean. I have no softness there, no&mdash;sympathy&mdash;sentiment&mdash;nonsense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What <hi rend="italics">was</hi> it that was borne in upon my mind when she stood still and looked attentively at me? Anything that I had seen in Miss Havisham? No. In some of her looks and gestures there was that tinge of resemblance
<pb n="166" id="p166b"/>
to Miss Havisham which may often be noticed to have been acquired by children, from grown persons with whom they have been much associated and secluded, and which, when childhood is past, will produce a remarkable occasional likeness of expression between faces that are otherwise quite different. And yet I could not trace this to Miss Havisham. I looked again, and though she was still looking at me, the suggestion was gone.</p>
<p>What <hi rend="italics">was</hi> it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am serious,&rdquo; said Estella, not so much with a frown (for her brow was smooth) as with a darkening of her face; &ldquo;if we are to be thrown much together, you had better believe it at once. No!&rdquo; imperiously stopping me as I opened my lips. &ldquo;I have not bestowed my tenderness anywhere. I have never had any such thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In another moment we were in the brewery so long disused, and she pointed to the high gallery where I had seen her going out on that same first day, and told me she remembered to have been up there, and to have seen me standing scared below.
<pb n="167" id="p167b"/>
As my eyes followed her white hand, again the same dim suggestion that I could not possibly grasp, crossed me. My involuntary start occasioned her to lay her hand upon my arm. Instantly the ghost passed once more, and was gone.</p>
<p>What <hi rend="italics">was</hi> it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; asked Estella. &ldquo;Are you scared again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be, if I believed what you said just now,&rdquo; I replied, to turn it off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you don't? Very well. It is said, at any rate. Miss Havisham will soon be expecting you at your old post, though I think that might be laid aside now, with other old belongings. Let us make one more round of the garden, and then go in. Come! You shall not shed tears for my cruelty to-day; you shall be my Page, and give me your shoulder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her handsome dress had trailed upon the ground. She held it in one hand now, and with the other lightly touched my shoulder as we walked. We walked round the ruined garden twice or thrice more, and it was all in bloom for me. If the green and yellow
<pb n="168" id="p168b"/>
growth of weed in the chinks of the old wall had been the most precious flowers that ever blew, it could not have been more cherished in my remembrance.</p>
<p>There was no discrepancy of years between us, to remove her far from me; we were of nearly the same age, though of course the age told for more in her case than in mine; but the air of inaccessibility which her beauty and her manner gave her, tormented me in the midst of my delight, and at the height of the assurance I felt that our patroness had chosen us for one another. Wretched boy!</p>
<p>At last we went back into the house, and there I heard, with surprise, that my guardian had come down to see Miss Havisham on business, and would come back to dinner. The old wintry branches of chandeliers in the room where the mouldering table was spread, had been lighted while we were out, and Miss Havisham was in her chair and waiting for me.</p>
<p>It was like pushing the chair itself back into the past, when we began the old slow circuit round about the ashes of the bridal
<pb n="169" id="p169b"/>
feast. But, in the funereal room, with that figure of the grave fallen back in the chair fixing its eyes upon her, Estella looked more bright and beautiful than before, and I was under stronger enchantment.</p>
<p>The time so melted away, that our early dinner-hour drew close at hand, and Estella left us to prepare herself. We had stopped near the centre of the long table, and Miss Havisham, with one of her withered arms stretched out of the chair, rested that clenched hand upon the yellow cloth. As Estella looked back over her shoulder before going out at the door, Miss Havisham kissed that hand to her, with a ravenous intensity that was of its kind quite dreadful.</p>
<p>Then, Estella being gone and we two left alone, she turned to me, and said in a whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she beautiful, graceful, well-grown? Do you admire her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody must who sees her, Miss Havisham.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She drew an arm round my neck, and drew my head close down to hers as she sat
<pb n="170" id="p170b"/>
in the chair. &ldquo;Love her, love her, love her! How does she use you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before I could answer (if I could have answered so difficult a question at all), she repeated, &ldquo;Love her, love her, love her! If she favours you, love her. If she wounds you, love her. If she tears your heart to pieces&mdash;and as it gets older and stronger, it will tear deeper&mdash;love her, love her, love her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Never had I seen such passionate eagerness as was joined to her utterance of these words. I could feel the muscles of the thin arm round my neck, swell with the vehemence that possessed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear me, Pip! I adopted her to be loved. I bred her and educated her, to be loved. I developed her into what she is, that she might be loved. Love her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said the word often enough, and there could be no doubt that she meant to say it; but if the often repeated word had been hate instead of love&mdash;despair&mdash;revenge&mdash;dire death&mdash;it could not have sounded from her lips more like a curse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll tell you,&rdquo; said she, in the same
<pb n="171" id="p171b"/>
hurried passionate whisper, &ldquo;what real love is. It is blind devotion, unquestioning self-humiliation, utter submission, trust and belief against yourself and against the whole world, giving up your whole heart and soul to the smiter&mdash;as I did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she came to that, and to a wild cry that followed that, I caught her round the waist. For she rose up in the chair, in her shroud of a dress, and struck at the air as if she would as soon have struck herself against the wall and fallen dead.</p>
<p>All this passed in a few seconds. As I drew her down into her chair, I was conscious of a scent that I knew, and turning, saw my guardian in the room.</p>
<p>He always carried (I have not yet mentioned it, I think) a pocket-handkerchief of rich silk and of imposing proportions, which was of great value to him in his profession. I have seen him so terrify a client or a witness by ceremoniously unfolding this pocket-handkerchief as if he were immediately going to blow his nose, and then pausing, as if he knew he should not have time to do it before such client or witness
<pb n="172" id="p172b"/>
committed himself, that the self-committal has followed directly, quite as a matter of course. When I saw him in the room, he had this expressive pocket-handkerchief in both hands, and was looking at us. On meeting my eye, he said plainly, by a momentary and silent pause in that attitude, &ldquo;Indeed? Singular!&rdquo; and then put the handkerchief to its right use with wonderful effect.</p>
<p>Miss Havisham had seen him as soon as I, and was (like everybody else) afraid of him. She made a strong attempt to compose herself, and stammered that he was as punctual as ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As punctual as ever,&rdquo; he repeated, coming up to us. &ldquo;(How do you do, Pip. Shall I give you a ride, Miss Havisham? Once round?) And so you are here, Pip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told him when I had arrived, and how Miss Havisham had wished me to come and see Estella. To which he replied, &ldquo;Ah! Very fine young lady!&rdquo; Then he pushed Miss Havisham in her chair before him, with one of his large hands, and put the other in
<pb n="173" id="p173b"/>
his trousers-pocket as if the pocket were full of secrets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Pip! How often have you seen Miss Estella before?&rdquo; said he, when he came to a stop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How often?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! How many times. Ten thousand times?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Certainly not so many.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jaggers,&rdquo; interposed Miss Havisham, much to my relief; &ldquo;leave my Pip alone, and go with him to your dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He complied, and we groped our way down the dark stairs together. While we were still on our way to those detached apartments across the paved yard at the back, he asked me how often I had seen Miss Havisham eat and drink; offering me a breadth of choice, as usual, between a hundred times and once.</p>
<p>I considered, and said, &ldquo;Never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And never will, Pip,&rdquo; he retorted, with a frowning smile. &ldquo;She has never allowed herself to be seen doing either, since she
<pb n="174" id="p174b"/>
lived this present life of hers. She wanders about in the night, and then lays hands on such food as she takes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray, sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;may I ask you a question?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and I may decline to answer it. Put your question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Estella's name. Is it Havisham, or&mdash;?&rdquo; I had nothing to add.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or what?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it Havisham?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Havisham.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This brought us to the dinner-table, where she and Sarah Pocket awaited us. Mr. Jaggers presided, Estella sat opposite to him, I faced my green and yellow friend. We dined very well, and were waited on by a maid servant whom I had never seen in all my comings and goings, but who, for anything I know, had been in that mysterious house the whole time. After dinner, a bottle of choice old port was placed before my guardian (he was evidently well acquainted with the vintage), and the two ladies left us.</p>
<p>Anything to equal the determined reticence
<pb n="175" id="p175b"/>
of Mr. Jaggers under that roof, I never saw elsewhere, even in him. He kept his very looks to himself, and scarcely directed his eyes to Estella's face once during dinner. When she spoke to him, he listened, and in due course answered, but never looked at her, that I could see. On the other hand, she often looked at him, with interest and curiosity, if not distrust, but his face never showed the least consciousness. Throughout dinner he took a dry delight in making Sarah Pocket greener and yellower, by often referring in conversation with me to my expectations; but here, again, he showed no consciousness, and even made it appear that he extorted&mdash;and even did extort, though I don't know how&mdash;those references out of my innocent self.</p>
<p>And when he and I were left alone together, he sat with an air upon him of general lying by in consequence of information he possessed, that really was too much for me. He cross-examined his very wine when he had nothing else in hand. He held it between himself and the candle, tasted the port, rolled it in his mouth, swallowed
<pb n="176" id="p176b"/>
it, looked at his glass again, smelt the port, tried it, drank it, filled again, and cross-examined the glass again, until I was as nervous as if I had known the wine to be telling him something to my disadvantage. Three or four times I feebly thought I would start conversation; but whenever he saw me going to ask him anything, he looked at me with his glass in his hand, and rolling his wine about in his mouth, as if requesting me to take notice that it was of no use, for he couldn't answer.</p>
<p>I think Miss Pocket was conscious that the sight of me involved her in the danger of being goaded to madness, and perhaps tearing off her cap&mdash;which was a very hideous one, in the nature of a muslin mop&mdash;and strewing the ground with her hair&mdash;which assuredly had never grown on <hi rend="italics">her</hi> head. She did not appear when we afterwards went up to Miss Havisham's room, and we four played at whist. In the interval, Miss Havisham, in a fantastic way, had put some of the most beautiful jewels from her dressing-table into Estella's hair, and about her bosom and arms; and I
<pb n="177" id="p177b"/>
saw even my guardian look at her from under his thick eyebrows, and raise them a little, when her loveliness was before him, with those rich flushes of glitter and colour in it.</p>
<p>Of the manner and extent to which he took our trumps into custody, and came out with mean little cards at the ends of hands, before which the glory of our Kings and Queens was utterly abased, I say nothing; nor, of the feeling that I had, respecting his looking upon us personally in the light of three very obvious and poor riddles that he had found out long ago. What I suffered from, was the incompatibility between his cold presence and my feelings towards Estella. It was not that I knew I could never bear to speak to him about her, that I knew I could never bear to hear him creak his boots at her, that I knew I could never bear to see him wash his hands of her; it was, that my admiration should be within a foot or two of him&mdash;it was, that my feelings should be in the same place with him&mdash;<hi rend="italics">that,</hi> was the agonising circumstance.</p>
<p>We played until nine o'clock, and then it was arranged that when Estella came to
<pb n="178" id="p178b"/>
London I should be forewarned of her coming and should meet her at the coach; and then I took leave of her, and touched her and left her.</p>
<p>My guardian lay at the Boar in the next room to mine. Far into the night, Miss Havisham's words, &ldquo;Love her, love her, love her!&rdquo; sounded in my ears. I adapted them for my own repetition, and said to my pillow, &ldquo;I love her, I love her, I love her!&rdquo; hundreds of times. Then, a burst of gratitude came upon me, that she should be destined for me, once the blacksmith's boy. Then, I thought if she were, as I feared, by no means rapturously grateful for that destiny yet, when would she begin to be interested in me? When should I awaken the heart within her, that was mute and sleeping now?</p>
<p>Ah me! I thought those were high and great emotions. But I never thought there was anything low and small in my keeping away from Joe, because I knew she would be contemptuous of him. It was but a day gone, and Joe had brought the tears into my eyes; they had soon dried, God forgive me! soon dried.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter">
<pb n="179" id="p179b"/>
<head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
<p>AFTER well considering the matter while I was dressing at the Blue Boar in the morning, I resolved to tell my guardian that I doubted Orlick's being the right sort of man to fill a post of trust at Miss Havisham's. &ldquo;Why, of course he is not the right sort of man, Pip,&rdquo; said my guardian, comfortably satisfied beforehand on the general head, &ldquo;because the man who fills the post of trust never is the right sort of man.&rdquo; It seemed quite to put him into spirits, to find that this particular post was not exceptionally held by the right sort of man, and he listened in a satisfied manner while I told him what knowledge I had of Orlick. &ldquo;Very good,
<pb n="180" id="p180b"/>
Pip,&rdquo; he observed, when I had concluded, &ldquo;I'll go round presently, and pay our friend off.&rdquo; Rather alarmed by this summary action, I was for a little delay, and even hinted that our friend himself might be difficult to deal with. &ldquo;Oh no he won't,&rdquo; said my guardian, making his pocket-handkerchief-point, with perfect confidence; &ldquo;I should like to see him argue the question with <hi rend="italics">me.</hi>&rdquo;</p>
<p>As we were going back together to London by the mid-day coach, and as I break-fasted under such terrors of Pumblechook that I could scarcely hold my cup, this gave me an opportunity of saying that I wanted a walk, and that I would go on along the London-road while Mr. Jaggers was occupied, if he would let the coachman know that I would get into my place when overtaken. I was thus enabled to fly from the Blue Boar immediately after breakfast. By then making a loop of about a couple of miles into the open country at the back of Pumblechook's premises, I got round into the High-street again, a little beyond that pitfall, and felt myself in comparative security.</p>
<pb n="181" id="p181b"/>
<p>It was interesting to be in the quiet old town once more, and it was not disagreeable to be here and there suddenly recognised and stared after. One or two of the trades-people even darted out of their shops and went a little way down the street before me, that they might turn, as if they had forgotten something, and pass me face to face&mdash;on which occasions I don't know whether they or I made the worse pretence; they of not doing it, or I of not seeing it. Still my position was a distinguished one, and I was not at all dissatisfied with it, until Fate threw me in the way of that unlimited miscreant, Trabb's boy.</p>
<p>Casting my eyes along the street at a certain point of my progress, I beheld Trabb's boy approaching, lashing himself with an empty blue bag. Deeming that a serene and unconscious contemplation of him would best beseem me, and would be most likely to quell his evil mind, I advanced with that expression of countenance, and was rather congratulating myself on my success, when suddenly the knees of Trabb's boy smote together, his hair uprose, his cap
<pb n="182" id="p182b"/>
fell off, he trembled violently in every limb, staggered out into the road, and crying to the populace, &ldquo;Hold me! I'm so frightened!&rdquo; feigned to be in a paroxysm of terror and contrition, occasioned by the dignity of my appearance. As I passed him, his teeth loudly chattered in his head, and with every mark of extreme humiliation, he prostrated himself in the dust.</p>
<p>This was a hard thing to bear, but this was nothing. I had not advanced another two hundred yards, when, to my inexpressible terror, amazement, and indignation, I again beheld Trabb's boy approaching. He was coming round a narrow corner. His blue bag was slung over his shoulder, honest industry beamed in his eyes, a determination to proceed to Trabb's with cheerful briskness was indicated in his gait. With a shock he became aware of me, and was severely visited as before; but this time his motion was rotatory, and he staggered round and round me with knees more afflicted, and with uplifted hands as if beseeching for mercy. His sufferings were hailed with the greatest joy by a knot of spectators, and I felt utterly confounded.</p>
<pb n="183" id="p183b"/>
<p>I had not got as much further down the street as the post-office, when I again beheld Trabb's boy shooting round by a back way. This time, he was entirely changed. He wore the blue bag in the manner of my great-coat, and was strutting along the pavement towards me on the opposite side of the street, attended by a company of delighted young friends to whom he from time to time exclaimed, with a wave of his hand, &ldquo;Don't know yah!&rdquo; Words cannot state the amount of aggravation and injury wreaked upon me by Trabb's boy, when, passing abreast of me, he pulled up his shirt-collar, twined his side-hair, stuck an arm akimbo, and smirked extravagantly by, wriggling his elbows and body, and drawling to his attendants, &ldquo;Don't know yah, don't know yah, pon my soul don't know yah!&rdquo; The disgrace attendant on his immediately afterwards taking to crowing and pursuing me across the bridge with crows, as from an exceedingly dejected fowl who had known me when I was a blacksmith, culminated the disgrace with which I left the town, and was, so to speak, ejected by it into the open country.</p>
<pb n="184" id="p184b"/>
<p>But unless I had taken the life of Trabb's boy on that occasion, I really do not even now see what I could have done save endure. To have struggled with him in the street, or to have exacted any lower recompense from him than his heart's best blood, would have been futile and degrading. Moreover, he was a boy whom no man could hurt; an invulnerable and dodging serpent who, when chased into a corner, flew out again between his captor's legs, scornfully yelping. I wrote, however, to Mr. Trabb by next day's post, to say that Mr. Pip must decline to deal further with one who could so far forget what he owed to the best interests of society, as to employ a boy who excited Loathing in every respectable mind.</p>
<p>The coach, with Mr. Jaggers inside, came up in due time, and I took my box-seat again, and arrived in London safe&mdash;but not sound, for my heart was gone. As soon as I arrived, I sent a penitential codfish and barrel of oysters to Joe (as reparation for not having gone myself), and then went on to Barnard's Inn.</p>
<p>I found Herbert dining on cold meat, and
<pb n="185" id="p185b"/>
delighted to welcome me back. Having despatched The Avenger to the coffee-house for an addition to the dinner, I felt that I must open my breast that very evening to my friend and chum. As confidence was out of the question with The Avenger in the hall, which could merely be regarded in the light of an ante-chamber to the keyhole, I sent him to the Play. A better proof of the severity of my bondage to that taskmaster could scarcely be afforded, than the degrading shifts to which I was constantly driven to find him employment. So mean is extremity, that I sometimes sent him to Hyde Park-corner to see what o'clock it was.</p>
<p>Dinner done and we sitting with our feet upon the fender, I said to Herbert, &ldquo;My dear Herbert, I have something very particular to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Handel,&rdquo; he returned, &ldquo;I shall esteem and respect your confidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It concerns myself, Herbert,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and one other person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herbert crossed his feet, looked at the fire with his head on one side, and having
<pb n="186" id="p186b"/>
looked at it in vain for some time, looked at me because I didn't go on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Herbert,&rdquo; said I, laying my hand upon his knee. &ldquo;I love&mdash;I adore&mdash;Estella.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of being transfixed, Herbert replied in an easy matter-of-course way, &ldquo;Exactly. Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Herbert? Is that all you say? Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What next, I mean?&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;Of course I know <hi rend="italics">that.</hi>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know it?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I know it, Handel? Why, from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never told you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Told me! You have never told me when you have got your hair cut, but I have had senses to perceive it. You have always adored her, ever since I have known you. You brought your adoration and your portmanteau here, together. Told me! Why, you have always told me all day long. When you told me your own story, you told me plainly that you began adoring her the first time you saw her, when you were very young indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="187" id="p187b"/>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; said I, to whom this was a new and not unwelcome light, &ldquo;I have never left off adoring her. And she has come back, a most beautiful and most elegant creature. And I saw her yesterday. And if I adored her before, I now doubly adore her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucky for you then, Handel,&rdquo; said Herbert, &ldquo;that you are picked out for her and allotted to her. Without encroaching on forbidden ground, we may venture to say that there can be no doubt between ourselves of that fact. Have you any idea yet, of Estella's views on the adoration question?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I shook my head gloomily. &ldquo;Oh! She is thousands of miles away, from me,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patience, my dear Handel: time enough, time enough. But you have something more to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am ashamed to say it,&rdquo; I returned, &ldquo;and yet it's no worse to say it than to think it. You call me a lucky fellow. Of course, I am. I was a blacksmith's boy but yesterday; I am&mdash;what shall I say I am&mdash;to day?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="188" id="p188b"/>
<p>&ldquo;Say, a good fellow, if you want a phrase,&rdquo; returned Herbert, smiling, and clapping his hand on the back of mine, &ldquo;a good fellow, with impetuosity and hesitation, boldness and diffidence, action and dreaming, curiously mixed in him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stopped for a moment to consider whether there really was this mixture in my character. On the whole, I by no means recognised the analysis, but thought it not worth disputing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I ask what I am to call myself to-day, Herbert,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;I suggest what I have in my thoughts. You say I am lucky. I know I have done nothing to raise myself in life, and that Fortune alone has raised me; that is being very lucky. And yet, when I think of Estella&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>(&ldquo;And when don't you, you know?&rdquo; Herbert threw in, with his eyes on the fire; which I thought kind and sympathetic of him.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;Then, my dear Herbert, I cannot tell you how dependent and uncertain I feel, and how exposed to hundreds of chances. Avoiding forbidden ground, as you did just
<pb n="189" id="p189b"/>
now, I may still say that on the constancy of one person (naming no person) all my expectations depend. And at the best, how indefinite and unsatisfactory, only to know so vaguely what they are!&rdquo; In saying this, I relieved my mind of what had always been there, more or less, though no doubt most since yesterday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Handel,&rdquo; Herbert replied, in his gay hopeful way, &ldquo;it seems to me that in the despondency of the tender passion, we are looking into our gift-horse's mouth with a magnifying glass. Likewise, it seems to me that, concentrating our attention on the examination, we altogether overlook one of the best points of the animal. Didn't you tell me that your guardian, Mr. Jaggers, told you in the beginning, that you were not endowed with expectations only? And even if he had not told you so&mdash;though that is a very large If, I grant&mdash;could you believe that of all men in London, Mr. Jaggers is the man to hold his present relations towards you unless he were sure of his ground?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said I could not deny that this was a strong point. I said it (people often do so,
<pb n="190" id="p190b"/>
in such cases) like a rather reluctant concession to truth and justice;&mdash;as if I wanted to deny it!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think it <hi rend="italics">was</hi> a strong point,&rdquo; said Herbert, &ldquo;and I should think you would be puzzled to imagine a stronger; as to the rest, you must bide your guardian's time, and he must bide his client's time. You'll be one-and-twenty before you know where you are, and then perhaps you'll get some further enlightenment. At all events, you'll be nearer getting it, for it must come at last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a hopeful disposition you have!&rdquo; said I, gratefully admiring his cheery ways.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to have,&rdquo; said Herbert, &ldquo;for I have not much else. I must acknowledge, by-the-by, that the good sense of what I have just said is not my own, but my father's. The only remark I ever heard him make on your story, was the final one: &lsquo;The thing is settled and done, or Mr. Jaggers would not be in it.&rsquo; And now before I say anything more about my father, or my father's son, and repay confidence with confidence, I want
<pb n="191" id="p191b"/>
to make myself seriously disagreeable to you for a moment&mdash;positively repulsive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won't succeed,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes I shall!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;One, two, three, and now I am in for it. Handel, my good fellow;&rdquo; though he spoke in this light tone, he was very much in earnest: &ldquo;I have been thinking since we have been talking with our feet on this fender, that Estella surely cannot be a condition of your inheritance, if she was never referred to by your guardian. Am I right in so understanding what you have told me, as that he never referred to her, directly or indirectly, in any way? Never even hinted, for instance, that your patron might have views as to your marriage ultimately?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Handel, I am quite free from the flavour of sour grapes, upon my soul and honour! Not being bound to her, can you not detach yourself from her?&mdash;I told you I should be disagreeable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I turned my head aside, for, with a rush and a sweep, like the old marsh winds coming
<pb n="192" id="p192b"/>
up from the sea, a feeling like that which had subdued me on the morning when I left the forge, when the mists were solemnly rising, and when I laid my hand upon the village finger-post, smote upon my heart again. There was silence between us for a little while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but my dear Handel,&rdquo; Herbert went on, as if we had been talking instead of silent, &ldquo;it's having been so strongly rooted in the breast of a boy whom nature and circumstances made so romantic, renders it very serious. Think of her bringing-up, and think of Miss Havisham. Think of what she is herself (now I am repulsive and you abominate me). This may lead to miserable things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it, Herbert,&rdquo; said I, with my head still turned away, &ldquo;but I can't help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can't detach yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Impossible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can't try, Handel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Impossible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said Herbert, getting up with a lively shake as if he had been asleep, and
<pb n="193" id="p193b"/>
stirring the fire; &ldquo;now I'll endeavour to make myself agreeable again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he went round the room and shook the curtains out, put the chairs in their places, tidied the books and so forth that were lying about, looked into the hall, peeped into the letter-box, shut the door, and came back to his chair by the fire: where he sat down, nursing his left leg in both arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was going to say a word or two, Handel, concerning my father and my father's son. I am afraid it is scarcely necessary for my father's son to remark that my father's establishment is not particularly brilliant in its housekeeping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is always plenty, Herbert,&rdquo; said I: to say something encouraging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes! and so the dustman says, I believe, with the strongest approval, and so does the marine store-shop in the back street. Gravely, Handel, for the subject is grave enough, you know how it is, as well as I do. I suppose there was a time once when my father had not given matters up; but if ever there was, the time is gone. May I ask you
<pb n="194" id="p194b"/>
if you have ever had an opportunity of remarking, down in your part of the country, that the children of not exactly suitable marriages, are always most particularly anxious to be married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was such a singular question, that I asked him in return, &ldquo;Is it so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; said Herbert, &ldquo;that's what I want to know. Because it is decidedly the case with us. My poor sister Charlotte who was next me and died before she was fourteen, was a striking example. Little Jane is the same. In her desire to be matrimonially established, you might suppose her to have passed her short existence in the perpetual contemplation of domestic bliss. Little Alick in a frock has already made arrangements for his union with a suitable young person at Kew. And indeed, I think we are all engaged, except the baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said Herbert; &ldquo;but it's a secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I assured him of my keeping the secret, and begged to be favoured with further particulars.
<pb n="195" id="p195b"/>
He had spoken so sensibly and feelingly of my weakness that I wanted to know something about his strength.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask the name?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Name of Clara,&rdquo; said Herbert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Live in London?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Perhaps I ought to mention,&rdquo; said Herbert, who had become curiously crestfallen and meek, since we entered on the interesting theme, &ldquo;that she is rather below my mother's nonsensical family notions. Her father had to do with the victualling of passenger-ships. I think he was a species of purser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is he now?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He's an invalid now,&rdquo; replied Herbert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Living on&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the first floor,&rdquo; said Herbert. Which was not at all what I meant, for I had intended my question to apply to his means. &ldquo;I have never seen him, for he has always kept his room overhead, since I have known Clara. But I have heard him constantly. He makes tremendous rows&mdash;roars, and pegs at the floor with some frightful instrument.&rdquo;
<pb n="196" id="p196b"/>
In looking at me and then laughing heartily, Herbert for the time recovered his usual lively manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't you expect to see him?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I constantly expect to see him,&rdquo; returned Herbert, &ldquo;because I never hear him, without expecting him to come tumbling through the ceiling. But I don't know how long the rafters may hold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he had once more laughed heartily, he became meek again, and told me that the moment he began to realise Capital, it was his intention to marry this young lady. He added as a self-evident proposition, engendering low spirits, &ldquo;But you <hi rend="italics">can't</hi> marry, you know, while you're looking about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As we contemplated the fire, and as I thought what a difficult vision to realise this same Capital sometimes was, I put my hands in my pockets. A folded piece of paper in one of them attracting my attention, I opened it and found it to be the playbill I had received from Joe, relative to the celebrated provincial amateur of Roscian renown. &ldquo;And bless my heart,&rdquo; I involuntarily added aloud, &ldquo;it's to-night!&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="197" id="p197b"/>
<p>This changed the subject in an instant, and made us hurriedly resolve to go to the play. So, when I had pledged myself to comfort and abet Herbert in the affair of his heart by all practicable and impracticable means, and when Herbert had told me that his affianced already knew me by reputation and that I should be presented to her, and when we had warmly shaken hands upon our mutual confidence, we blew out our candles, made up our fire, locked our door, and issued forth in quest of Mr. Wopsle and Denmark.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter">
<pb n="198" id="p198b"/>
<head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
<p>ON our arrival in Denmark, we found the king and queen of that country elevated in two arm-chairs on a kitchen-table, holding a Court. The whole of the Danish nobility were in attendance; consisting of a noble boy in the wash-leather boots of a gigantic ancestor, a venerable Peer with a dirty face who seemed to have risen from the people late in life, and the Danish chivalry with a comb in its hair and a pair of white silk legs, and presenting on the whole a feminine appearance. My gifted townsman stood gloomily apart, with folded arms, and I could have wished that his curls and fore-head had been more probable.</p>
<pb n="199" id="p199b"/>
<p>Several curious little circumstances transpired as the action proceeded. The late king of the country not only appeared to have been troubled with a cough at the time of his decease, but to have taken it with him to the tomb, and to have brought it back. The royal phantom also carried a ghostly manuscript round its truncheon, to which it had the appearance of occasionally referring, and that, too, with an air of anxiety and a tendency to lose the place of reference which were suggestive of a state of mortality. It was this, I conceive, which led to the Shade's being advised by the gallery to &ldquo;turn over!&rdquo;&mdash;a recommendation which it took extremely ill. It was likewise to be noted of this majestic spirit that whereas it always appeared with an air of having been out a long time and walked an immense distance, it perceptibly came from a closely contiguous wall. This occasioned its terrors to be received derisively. The Queen of Denmark, a very buxom lady, though no doubt historically brazen, was considered by the public to have too much brass about her; her chin being attached to her diadem by a broad band of
<pb n="200" id="p200b"/>
that metal (as if she had a gorgeous toothache), her waist being encircled by another, and each of her arms by another, so that she was openly mentioned as &ldquo;the kettledrum.&rdquo; The noble boy in the ancestral boots, was inconsistent; representing himself, as it were in one breath, as an able seaman, a strolling actor, a gravedigger, a clergyman, and a person of the utmost importance at a Court fencing-match, on the authority of whose practised eye and nice discrimination the finest strokes were judged. This gradually led to a want of toleration for him, and even&mdash;on his being detected in holy orders, and declining to perform the funeral service&mdash;to the general indignation taking the form of nuts. Lastly, Ophelia was a prey to such slow musical madness, that when, in course of time, she had taken off her white muslin scarf, folded it up, and buried it, a sulky man who had been long cooling his impatient nose against an iron bar in the front row of the gallery, growled, &ldquo;Now the baby's put to bed let's have supper!&rdquo; Which, to say the least of it, was out of keeping.</p>
<pb n="201" id="p201b"/>
<p>Upon my unfortunate townsman all these incidents accumulated with playful effect. Whenever that undecided Prince had to ask a question or state a doubt, the public helped him out with it. As for example; on the question whether 'twas nobler in the mind to suffer, some roared yes, and some no, and some inclining to both opinions said &ldquo;toss up for it;&rdquo; and quite a Debating Society arose. When he asked what should such fellows as he do crawling between earth and heaven, he was encouraged with loud cries of &ldquo;Hear, hear!&rdquo; When he appeared with his stocking disordered (its disorder expressed, according to usage, by one very neat fold in the top, which I suppose to be always got up with a flat iron), a conversation took place in the gallery respecting the paleness of his leg, and whether it was occasioned by the turn the ghost had given him. On his taking the recorders&mdash;very like a little black flute that had just been played in the orchestra and handed out at the door&mdash;he was called upon unanimously for Rule Britannia. When he recommended the player not to saw the air thus, the sulky
<pb n="202" id="p202b"/>
man said, &ldquo;And don't <hi rend="italics">you</hi> do it, neither; you're a deal worse than <hi rend="italics">him!</hi>&rdquo; And I grieve to add that peals of laughter greeted Mr. Wopsle on every one of these occasions.</p>
<p>But his greatest trials were in the churchyard: which had the appearance of a primeval forest, with a kind of small ecclesiastical wash-house on one side, and a turnpike-gate on the other. Mr. Wopsle in a comprehensive black cloak, being described entering at the turnpike, the gravedigger was admonished in a friendly way, &ldquo;Look out! Here's the undertaker a coming, to see how you're a getting on with your work!&rdquo; I believe it is well known in a constitutional country that Mr. Wopsle could not possibly have returned the skull, after moralising over it, without dusting his fingers on a white napkin taken from his breast; but even that innocent and indispensable action did not pass without the comment &ldquo;Wai-ter!&rdquo; The arrival of the body for interment (in an empty black box with the lid tumbling open), was the signal for a general joy which was much enhanced by the discovery, among the bearers, of an individual obnoxious
<pb n="203" id="p203b"/>
to identification. The joy attended Mr. Wopsle through his struggle with Laertes on the brink of the orchestra and the grave, and slackened no more until he had tumbled the king off the kitchen-table, and had died by inches from the ankles upward.</p>
<p>We had made some pale efforts in the beginning to applaud Mr. Wopsle; but they were too hopeless to be persisted in. Therefore we had sat, feeling keenly for him, but laughing, nevertheless, from ear to ear. I laughed in spite of myself all the time, the whole thing was so droll; and yet I had a latent impression that there was something decidedly fine in Mr. Wopsle's elocution&mdash;not for old associations' sake, I am afraid, but because it was very slow, very dreary, very up-hill and down-hill, and very unlike any way in which any man in any natural circumstances of life or death ever expressed himself about anything. When the tragedy was over, and he had been called for and hooted, I said to Herbert, &ldquo;Let us go at once, or perhaps we shall meet him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We made all the haste we could down stairs, but we were not quick enough either.
<pb n="204" id="p204b"/>
Standing at the door was a Jewish man with an unnaturally heavy smear of eye-brow, who caught my eyes as we advanced, and said, when we came up with him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Pip and friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Identity of Mr. Pip and friend confessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Waldengarver,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;would be glad to have the honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waldengarver?&rdquo; I repeated&mdash;when Herbert murmured in my ear, &ldquo;Probably Wopsle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Yes. Shall we follow you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few steps, please.&rdquo; When we were in a side alley, he turned and asked, &ldquo;How did you think he looked?&mdash;<hi rend="italics">I</hi> dressed him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don't know what he had looked like, except a funeral; with the addition of a large Danish sun or star hanging round his neck by a blue ribbon, that had given him the appearance of being insured in some extraordinary Fire Office. But I said he had looked very nice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he come to the grave,&rdquo; said our conductor, &ldquo;he showed his cloak beautiful. But, judging from the wing, it looked to me
<pb n="205" id="p205b"/>
that when he see the ghost in the queen's apartment, he might have made more of his stockings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I modestly assented, and we all fell through a little dirty swing door, into a sort of hot packing-case immediately behind it. Here Mr. Wopsle was divesting himself of his Danish garments, and here there was just room for us to look at him over one another's shoulders, by keeping the packingcase door, or lid, wide open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said Mr. Wopsle, &ldquo;I am proud to see you. I hope, Mr. Pip, you will excuse my sending round. I had the happiness to know you in former times, and the Drama has ever had a claim which has ever been acknowledged, on the noble and the affluent.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Waldengarver, in a frightful perspiration, was trying to get himself out of his princely sables.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Skin the stockings off, Mr. Waldengarver,&rdquo; said the owner of that property, &ldquo;or you'll bust 'em. Bust 'em, and you'll bust five-and-thirty shillings. Shakspeare never was complimented with a finer pair.
<pb n="206" id="p206b"/>
Keep quiet in your chair now, and leave 'em to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that, he went upon his knees, and began to flay his victim; who, on the first stocking coming off, would certainly have fallen over backward with his chair, but for there being no room to fall anyhow.</p>
<p>I had been afraid until then to say a word about the play. But then, Mr. Waldengarver looked up at us complacently, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen, how did it seem to you, to go, in front?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herbert said from behind (at the same time poking me), &ldquo;capitally.&rdquo; So I said &ldquo;capitally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you like my reading of the character, gentlemen?&rdquo; said Mr. Waldengarver, almost, if not quite, with patronage.</p>
<p>Herbert said from behind (again poking me), &ldquo;massive and concrete.&rdquo; So I said boldly, as if I had originated it, and must beg to insist upon it, &ldquo;massive and concrete.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to have your approbation, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Mr. Waldengarver, with an air of dignity, in spite of his being
<pb n="207" id="p207b"/>
ground against the wall at the time, and holding on by the seat of the chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I'll tell you one thing, Mr. Waldengarver,&rdquo; said the man who was on his knees, &ldquo;in which you're out in your reading. Now mind! I don't care who says contrairy; I tell you so. You're out in your reading of Hamlet when you get your legs in profile. The last Hamlet as I dressed, made the same mistakes in his reading at rehearsal, till I got him to put a large red wafer on each of his shins, and then at that rehearsal (which was the last) I went in front, sir, to the back of the pit, and whenever his reading brought him into profile, I called out &lsquo;I don't see no wafers!&rsquo; And at night his reading was lovely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Waldengarver smiled at me, as much as to say &ldquo;a faithful dependent&mdash;I overlook his folly;&rdquo; and then said aloud, &ldquo;My view is a little classic and thoughtful for them here; but they will improve, they will improve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herbert and I said together, Oh, no doubt they would improve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you observe, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Mr.
<pb n="208" id="p208b"/>
Waldengarver, &ldquo;that there was a man in the gallery who endeavoured to cast derision on the service&mdash;I mean, the representation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We basely replied that we rather thought we had noticed such a man. I added, &ldquo;He was drunk, no doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear no, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Wopsle, &ldquo;not drunk. His employer would see to that, sir. His employer would not allow him to be drunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know his employer?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>Mr. Wopsle shut his eyes, and opened them again; performing both ceremonies very slowly. &ldquo;You must have observed, gentlemen,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;an ignorant and a blatant ass, with a rasping throat and a countenance expressive of low malignity, who went through&mdash;I will not say sustained&mdash;the r&ocirc;le (if I may use a French expression) of Claudius King of Denmark. That is his employer, gentlemen. Such is the profession!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without distinctly knowing whether I should have been more sorry for Mr. Wopsle if he had been in despair, I was so sorry
<pb n="209" id="p209b"/>
for him as it was, that I took the opportunity of his turning round to have his braces put on&mdash;which jostled us out at the doorway&mdash;to ask Herbert what he thought of having him home to supper? Herbert said he thought it would be kind to do so; therefore I invited him, and he went to Barnard's with us, wrapped up to the eyes, and we did our best for him, and he sat until two o'clock in the morning, reviewing his success and developing his plans. I forget in detail what they were, but I have a general recollection that he was to begin with reviving the Drama, and to end with crushing it; inasmuch as his decease would leave it utterly bereft and without a chance or hope.</p>
<p>Miserably I went to bed after all, and miserably thought of Estella, and miserably dreamed that my expectations were all cancelled, and that I had to give my hand in marriage to Herbert's Clara, or play Hamlet to Miss Havisham's Ghost, before twenty thousand people, without knowing twenty words of it.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
<p>ONE day when I was busy with my books and Mr. Pocket, I received a note by the post, the mere outside of which threw me into a great flutter; for, though I had never seen the handwriting in which it was addressed, I divined whose hand it was. It had no set beginning, as Dear Mr. Pip, or Dear Pip, or Dear Sir, or Dear Anything, but ran thus:</p>
<q>
<text>
<body>
<div1 type="letter">
<p>&ldquo;I am to come to London the day after to-morrow by the mid-day coach. I believe it was settled you should meet me? At all events Miss Havisham has that impression, and I write in obedience to it. She sends you her regard.</p>
<closer>
<signed>&ldquo;Yours, ESTELLA.&rdquo;</signed>
</closer>
</div1>
</body>
</text>
</q>
<pb n="211" id="p211b"/>
<p>If there had been time, I should probably have ordered several suits of clothes for this occasion; but as there was not, I was fain to be content with those I had. My appetite vanished instantly, and I knew no peace or rest until the day arrived. Not that its arrival brought me either; for, then I was worse than ever, and began haunting the coach-office in Wood-street, Cheapside, before the coach had left the Blue Boar in our town. For all that I knew this perfectly well, I still felt as if it were not safe to let the coach-office be out of my sight longer than five minutes at a time; and in this condition of unreason I had performed the first half-hour of a watch of four or five hours, when Wemmick ran against me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halloa, Mr. Pip,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;how do you do? I should hardly have thought this was <hi rend="italics">your</hi> beat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I explained that I was waiting to meet somebody who was coming up by coach, and I inquired after the Castle and the Aged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both flourishing, thankye,&rdquo; said Wemmick,
<pb n="212" id="p212b"/>
&ldquo;and particularly the Aged. He's in wonderful feather. He'll be eighty-two next birthday. I have a notion of firing eighty-two times, if the neighbourhood shouldn't complain, and that cannon of mine should prove equal to the pressure. However, this is not London talk. Where do you think I am going to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the office?&rdquo; said I, for he was tending in that direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next thing to it,&rdquo; returned Wemmick, &ldquo;I am going to Newgate. We are in a banker's-parcel case just at present, and I have been down the road taking a squint at the scene of action, and thereupon must have a word or two with our client.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did your client commit the robbery?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless your soul and body, no,&rdquo; answered Wemmick, very dryly. &ldquo;But he is accused of it. So might you or I be. Either of us might be accused of it, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only neither of us is,&rdquo; I remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yah!&rdquo; said Wemmick, touching me on the breast with his forefinger; &ldquo;you're a deep one, Mr. Pip! Would you like to
<pb n="213" id="p213b"/>
have a look at Newgate? Have you time to spare?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had so much time to spare, that the proposal came as a relief, notwithstanding its irreconcilability with my latent desire to keep my eye on the coach-office. Muttering that I would make the inquiry whether I had time to walk with him, I went into the office, and ascertained from the clerk with the nicest precision and much to the trying of his temper, the earliest moment at which the coach could be expected&mdash;which I knew beforehand, quite as well as he. I then rejoined Mr. Wemmick, and affecting to consult my watch and to be surprised by the information I had received, accepted his offer.</p>
<p>We were at Newgate in a few minutes, and we passed through the lodge where some fetters were hanging up on the bare walls among the prison rules, into the interior of the jail. At that time, jails were much neglected, and the period of exaggerated reaction consequent on all public wrong-doing&mdash;and which is always its heaviest and longest punishment&mdash;was still far
<pb n="214" id="p214b"/>
off. So, felons were not lodged and fed better than soldiers (to say nothing of paupers), and seldom set fire to their prisons with the excusable object of improving the flavour of their soup. It was visiting time when Wemmick took me in; and a potman was going his rounds with beer; and the prisoners, behind bars in yards, were buying beer, and talking to friends; and a frouzy, ugly, disorderly, depressing scene it was.</p>
<p>It struck me that Wemmick walked among the prisoners, much as a gardener might walk among his plants. This was first put into my head by his seeing a shoot that had come up in the night, and saying, &ldquo;What, Captain Tom? Are <hi rend="italics">you</hi> there? Ah, indeed!&rdquo; and also, &ldquo;Is that Black Bill behind the cistern? Why I didn't look for you these two months; how do you find yourself?&rdquo; Equally in his stopping at the bars and attending to anxious whisperers&mdash;always singly&mdash;Wemmick with his post-office in an immovable state, looked at them while in conference, as if he were taking particular notice of the advance they had
<pb n="215" id="p215b"/>
made, since last observed, towards coming out in full blow at their trial.</p>
<p>He was highly popular, and I found that he took the familiar department of Mr. Jaggers's business: though something of the state of Mr. Jaggers hung about him too, forbidding approach beyond certain limits. His personal recognition of each successive client was comprised in a nod, and in his settling his hat a little easier on his head with both hands, and than tightening the post-office, and putting his hands in his pockets. In one or two instances, there was a difficulty respecting the raising of fees, and then Mr. Wemmick, backing as far as possible from the insufficient money produced, said, &ldquo;Its no use, my boy. I'm only a subordinate. I can't take it. Don't go on in that way with a subordinate. If you are unable to make up your quantum, my boy, you had better address yourself to a principal; there are plenty of principals in the profession, you know, and what is not worth the while of one, may be worth the while of another; that's my recommendation
<pb n="216" id="p216b"/>
to you, speaking as a subordinate. Don't try on useless measures. Why should you? Now, who's next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus, we walked through Wemmick's greenhouse, until he turned to me and said, &ldquo;Notice the man I shall shake hands with.&rdquo; I should have done so, without the preparation, as he had shaken hands with no one yet.</p>
<p>Almost as soon as he had spoken, a portly upright man (whom I can see now, as I write) in a well-worn olive-coloured frock-coat, with a peculiar pallor overspreading the red in his complexion, and eyes that went wandering about when he tried to fix them, came up to a corner of the bars, and put his hand to his hat&mdash;which had a greasy and fatty surface like cold broth&mdash;with a half-serious and half-jocose military salute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colonel, to you!&rdquo; said Wemmick; &ldquo;how are you, Colonel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Mr. Wemmick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything was done that could be done, but the evidence was too strong for us, Colonel.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="217" id="p217b"/>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was too strong, sir&mdash;but <hi rend="italics">I</hi> don't care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Wemmick, coolly, &ldquo;<hi rend="italics">you</hi> don't care.&rdquo; Then, turning to me, &ldquo;Served His Majesty this man. Was a soldier in the line and bought his discharge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; and the man's eyes looked at me, and then looked over my head, and then looked all round me, and then he drew his hand across his lips and laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I shall be out of this on Monday, sir,&rdquo; he said to Wemmick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; returned my friend, &ldquo;but there's no knowing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to have the chance of bidding you good-by, Mr. Wemmick,&rdquo; said the man, stretching out his hand between two bars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thankye,&rdquo; said Wemmick, shaking hands with him. &ldquo;Same to you, Colonel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If what I had upon me when taken, had been real, Mr. Wemmick,&rdquo; said the man unwilling to let his hand go, &ldquo;I should have asked the favour of your wearing another
<pb n="218" id="p218b"/>
ring&mdash;in acknowledgment of your attentions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll accept the will for the deed,&rdquo; said Wemmick. &ldquo;By-the-by; you were quite a pigeon-fancier.&rdquo; The man looked up at the sky. &ldquo;I am told you had a remarkable breed of tumblers. <hi rend="italics">Could</hi> you commission any friend of yours to bring me a pair, if you've no further use for 'em?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shall be done, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Wemmick, &ldquo;they shall be taken care of. Good afternoon, Colonel. Good-by!&rdquo; They shook hands again, and as we walked away Wemmick said to me, &ldquo;A Coiner, a very good workman. The Recorder's report is made to-day, and he is sure to be executed on Monday. Still you see, as far as it goes, a pair of pigeons are portable property, all the same.&rdquo; With that, he looked back, and nodded at this dead plant, and then cast his eyes about him in walking out of the yard, as if he were considering what other pot would go best in its place.</p>
<p>As we came out of the prison through the lodge, I found that the great importance
<pb n="219" id="p219b"/>
of my guardian was appreciated by the turnkeys, no less than by those whom they held in charge. &ldquo;Well, Mr. Wemmick,&rdquo; said the turnkey who kept us between the two studded and spiked lodge gates, and who carefully locked one before he unlocked the other, &ldquo;what's Mr. Jaggers going to do with that waterside murder? Is he going to make it manslaughter, or what's he going to make of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don't you ask him?&rdquo; returned Wemmick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I dare say!&rdquo; said the turnkey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, that's the way with them here, Mr. Pip,&rdquo; remarked Wemmick, turning to me with his post-office elongated. &ldquo;They don't mind what they ask of me, the subordinate; but you'll never catch 'em asking any questions of my principal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this young gentleman one of the 'prentices or articled ones of your office?&rdquo; asked the turnkey, with a grin at Mr. Wemmick's humour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he goes again, you see!&rdquo; cried Wemmick, &ldquo;I told you so! Asks another question of the subordinate before his first
<pb n="220" id="p220b"/>
is dry! Well, supposing Mr. Pip is one of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why then,&rdquo; said the turnkey, grinning again, &ldquo;he knows what Mr. Jaggers is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yah!&rdquo; cried Wemmick, suddenly hitting out at the turnkey in a facetious way, &ldquo;you're as dumb as one of your own keys when you have to do with my principal, you know you are. Let us out, you old fox, or I'll get him to bring an action against you for false imprisonment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The turnkey laughed, and gave us good day, and stood laughing at us over the spikes of the wicket when we descended the steps into the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind you, Mr. Pip,&rdquo; said Wemmick, gravely in my ear, as he took my arm to be more confidential; &ldquo;I don't know that Mr. Jaggers does a better thing than the way in which he keeps himself so high. He's always so high. His constant height is of a piece with his immense abilities. That Colonel durst no more take leave of <hi rend="italics">him,</hi> than that turnkey durst ask him his intentions respecting a case. Then, between his height and them, he slips in his subordinate&mdash;don't
<pb n="221" id="p221b"/>
you see?&mdash;and so he has 'em, soul and body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was very much impressed, and not for the first time, by my guardian's subtlety. To confess the truth, I very heartily wished, and not for the first time, that I had had some other guardian of minor abilities.</p>
<p>Mr. Wemmick and I parted at the office in Little Britain, where suppliants for Mr. Jaggers's notice were lingering about as usual, and I returned to my watch in the street of the coach-office, with some three hours on hand. I consumed the whole time in thinking how strange it was that I should be encompassed by all this taint of prison and crime; that, in my childhood out on our lonely marshes on a winter evening I should have first encountered it; that, it should have reappeared on two occasions, starting out like a stain that was faded but not gone; that, it should in this new way pervade my fortune and advancement. While my mind was thus engaged, I thought of the beautiful young Estella, proud and refined, coming towards me, and I thought with absolute abhorrence of the contrast
<pb n="222" id="p222b"/>
between the jail and her. I wished that Wemmick had not met me, or that I had not yielded to him and gone with him, so that, of all days in the year on this day, I might not have had Newgate in my breath and on my clothes. I beat the prison dust off my feet as I sauntered to and fro, and I shook it out of my dress, and I exhaled its air from my lungs. So contaminated did I feel, remembering who was coming, that the coach came quickly after all, and I was not yet free from the soiling consciousness of Mr. Wemmick's conservatory, when I saw her face at the coach window and her hand waving to me.</p>
<p>What <hi rend="italics">was</hi> the nameless shadow which again in that one instant had passed?</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter">
<pb n="223" id="p223b"/>
<head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
<p>IN her furred travelling-dress, Estella seemed more delicately beautiful than she had ever seemed yet, even in my eyes. Her manner was more winning than she had cared to let it be to me before, and I thought I saw Miss Havisham's influence in the change.</p>
<p>We stood in the Inn Yard while she pointed out her luggage to me, and when it was all collected I remembered&mdash;having forgotten everything but herself in the mean while&mdash;that I knew nothing of her destination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to Richmond,&rdquo; she told me. &ldquo;Our lesson is, that there are two Richmonds,
<pb n="224" id="p224b"/>
one in Surrey and one in Yorkshire, and that mine is the Surrey Richmond. The distance is ten miles. I am to have a carriage, and you are to take me. This is my purse, and you are to pay my charges out of it. Oh, you must take the purse! We have no choice, you and I, but to obey our instructions. We are not free to follow our own devices, you and I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she looked at me in giving me the purse, I hoped there was an inner meaning in her words. She said them slightingly, but not with displeasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A carriage will have to be sent for, Estella. Will you rest here a little?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am to rest here a little, and I am to drink some tea, and you are to take care of me the while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She drew her arm through mine, as if it must be done, and I requested a waiter who had been staring at the coach like a man who had never seen such a thing in his life, to show us a private sitting-room. Upon that, he pulled out a napkin, as if it were a magic clue without which he couldn't find the way up-stairs, and led us to the black
<pb n="225" id="p225b"/>
hole of the establishment: fitted up with a diminishing mirror (quite a superfluous article considering the hole's proportions), an anchovy sauce-cruet, and somebody's pattens. On my objecting to this retreat, he took us into another room with a dinner-table for thirty, and in the grate a scorched leaf of a copy-book under a bushel of coal-dust. Having looked at this extinct conflagration and shaken his head, he took my order: which, proving to be merely &ldquo;Some tea for the lady,&rdquo; sent him out of the room in a very low state of mind.</p>
<p>I was, and I am, sensible that the air of this chamber, in its strong combination of stable with soup-stock, might have led one to infer that the coaching department was not doing well, and that the enterprising proprietor was boiling down the horses for the refreshment department. Yet the room was all in all to me, Estella being in it. I thought that with her I could have been happy there for life. (I was not at all happy there at the time, observe, and I knew it well.)</p>
<pb n="226" id="p226b"/>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going to, at Richmond?&rdquo; I asked Estella.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to live,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;at a great expense, with a lady there, who has the power&mdash;or says she has&mdash;of taking me about, and introducing me, and showing people to me and showing me to people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you will be glad of variety and admiration?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She answered so carelessly, that I said, &ldquo;You speak of yourself as if you were some one else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you learn how I speak of others? Come, come,&rdquo; said Estella, smiling delightfully, &ldquo;you must not expect me to go to school to <hi rend="italics">you;</hi> I must talk in my own way. How do you thrive with Mr. Pocket?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I live quite pleasantly there; at least&mdash;&rdquo; It appeared to me that I was losing a chance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least?&rdquo; repeated Estella.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As pleasantly as I could anywhere, away from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You silly boy,&rdquo; said Estella, quite composedly,
<pb n="227" id="p227b"/>
&ldquo;how can you talk such nonsense? Your friend Mr. Matthew, I believe, is superior to the rest of his family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very superior indeed. He is nobody's enemy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't add but his own,&rdquo; interposed Estella, &ldquo;for I hate that class of man. But he really is disinterested, and above small jealousy and spite, I have heard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure I have every reason to say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have not every reason to say so of the rest of his people,&rdquo; said Estella, nodding at me with an expression of face that was at once grave and rallying, &ldquo;for they beset Miss Havisham with reports and insinuations to your disadvantage. They watch you, misrepresent you, write letters about you (anonymous sometimes), and you are the torment and the occupation of their lives. You can scarcely realise to yourself the hatred those people feel for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do me no harm, I hope?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>Instead of answering, Estella burst out laughing. This was very singular to me, and I looked at her in considerable perplexity.
<pb n="228" id="p228b"/>
When she left off&mdash;and she had not laughed languidly, but with real enjoyment&mdash;I said, in my diffident way with her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I may suppose that you would not be amused if they did me any harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, you may be sure of that,&rdquo; said Estella. &ldquo;You may be certain that I laugh because they fail. Oh, those people with Miss Havisham, and the tortures they undergo!&rdquo; She laughed again, and even now when she had told me why, her laughter was very singular to me, for I could not doubt its being genuine, and yet it seemed too much for the occasion. I thought there must really be something more here than I knew; she saw the thought in my mind, and answered it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not easy for even you,&rdquo; said Estella, &ldquo;to know what satisfaction it gives me to see those people thwarted, or what an enjoyable sense of the ridiculous I have when they are made ridiculous. For you were not brought up in that strange house from a mere baby.&mdash;I was. You had not your little wits sharpened by their intriguing against you, suppressed and defenceless,
<pb n="229" id="p229b"/>
under the mask of sympathy and pity and what not that is soft and soothing.&mdash;I had. You did not gradually open your round childish eyes wider and wider to the discovery of that impostor of a woman who calculates her stores of peace of mind for when she wakes up in the night.&mdash;I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was no laughing matter with Estella now, nor was she summoning these remembrances from any shallow place. I would not have been the cause of that look of hers, for all my expectations in a heap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two things I can tell you,&rdquo; said Estella. &ldquo;First, notwithstanding the proverb that constant dropping will wear away a stone, you may set your mind at rest that these people never will&mdash;never would, in a hundred years&mdash;impair your ground with Miss Havisham, in any particular, great or small. Second, I am beholden to you as the cause of their being so busy and so mean in vain, and there is my hand upon it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she gave it me playfully&mdash;for her darker mood had been but momentary&mdash;I held it and put it to my lips. &ldquo;You ridiculous boy,&rdquo; said Estella, &ldquo;will you never
<pb n="230" id="p230b"/>
take warning? Or do you kiss my hand in the spirit in which I once let you kiss my cheek?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must think a moment. A spirit of contempt for the fawners and plotters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I say yes, may I kiss the cheek again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should have asked before you touched the hand. But, yes, if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I leaned down, and her calm face was like a statue's. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Estella, gliding away the instant I touched her cheek, &ldquo;you are to take care that I have some tea, and you are to take me to Richmond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her reverting to this tone as if our association were forced upon us and we were mere puppets, gave me pain; but everything in our intercourse did give me pain. Whatever her tone with me happened to be, I could put no trust in it, and build no hope on it; and yet I went on against trust and against hope. Why repeat it a thousand times? So it always was.</p>
<p>I rang for the tea, and the waiter, reappearing with his magic clue, brought in by degrees some fifty adjuncts to that refreshment,
<pb n="231" id="p231b"/>
but of tea not a glimpse. A teaboard, cups and saucers, plates, knives and forks (including carvers), spoons (various), salt-cellars, a meek little muffin confined with the utmost precaution under a strong iron cover, Moses in the bullrushes typified by a soft bit of butter in a quantity of parsley, a pale loaf with a powdered head, two proof impressions of the bars of the kitchen fireplace on triangular bits of bread, and ultimately a fat family urn: which the waiter staggered in with, expressing in his countenance burden and suffering. After a prolonged absence at this stage of the entertainment, he at length came back with a casket of precious appearance containing twigs. These I steeped in hot water, and so from the whole of these appliances extracted one cup of I don't know what, for Estella.</p>
<p>The bill paid, and the waiter remembered, and the ostler not forgotten, and the chambermaid taken into consideration&mdash;in a word, the whole house bribed into a state of contempt and animosity, and Estella's purse much lightened&mdash;we got into our post-coach and drove away. Turning into Cheapside
<pb n="232" id="p232b"/>
and rattling up Newgate-street, we were soon under the walls of which I was so ashamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What place is that?&rdquo; Estella asked me.</p>
<p>I made a foolish pretence of not at first recognising it, and then told her. As she looked at it, and drew in her head again, murmuring &ldquo;Wretches!&rdquo; I would not have confessed to my visit for any consideration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Jaggers,&rdquo; said I, by way of putting it neatly on somebody else, &ldquo;has the reputation of being more in the secrets of that dismal place than any man in London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is more in the secrets of every place, I think,&rdquo; said Estella, in a low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been accustomed to see him often, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been accustomed to see him at uncertain intervals, ever since I can remember. But I know him no better now, than I did before I could speak plainly. What is your own experience of him? Do you advance with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once habituated to his distrustful manner,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I have done very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you intimate?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="233" id="p233b"/>
<p>&ldquo;I have dined with him at his private house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancy,&rdquo; said Estella, shrinking, &ldquo;that must be a curious place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a curious place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I should have been chary of discussing my guardian too freely even with her; but I should have gone on with the subject so far as to describe the dinner in Gerrard-street, if we had not then come into a sudden glare of gas. It seemed, while it lasted, to be all alight and alive with that inexplicable feeling I had had before; and when we were out of it, I was as much dazed for a few moments as if I had been in Lightning.</p>
<p>So, we fell into other talk, and it was principally about the way by which we were travelling, and about what parts of London lay on this side of it, and what on that. The great city was almost new to her, she told me, for she had never left Miss Havisham's neighbourhood until she had gone to France and she had merely passed through London then in going and returning. I asked her if my guardian had any charge of her while
<pb n="234" id="p234b"/>
she remained here? To that she emphatically said &ldquo;God forbid!&rdquo; and no more.</p>
<p>It was impossible for me to avoid seeing that she cared to attract me; that she made herself winning; and would have won me even if the task had needed pains. Yet this made me none the happier, for, even if she had not taken that tone of our being disposed of by others, I should have felt that she held my heart in her hand because she wilfully chose to do it, and not because it would have wrung any tenderness in her, to crush it and throw it away.</p>
<p>When we passed through Hammersmith, I showed her where Mr. Matthew Pocket lived, and said it was no great way from Richmond, and that I hoped I should see her sometimes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, you are to see me; you are to come when you think proper; you are to be mentioned to the family; indeed you are already mentioned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I inquired was it a large household she was going to be a member of?</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; there are only two; mother and daughter. The mother is a lady of some
<pb n="235" id="p235b"/>
station, I believe, though not averse to increasing her income.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder Miss Havisham could part with you again so soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a part of Miss Havisham's plans for me, Pip,&rdquo; said Estella, with a sigh, as if she were tired; &ldquo;I am to write to her constantly and see her regularly, and report how I go on&mdash;I and the jewels&mdash;for they are nearly all mine now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the first time she had ever called me by my name. Of course she did so, purposely, and knew that I should treasure it up.</p>
<p>We came to Richmond all too soon, and our destination there, was a house by the Green; a staid old house, where hoops and powder and patches, embroidered coats rolled stockings ruffles and swords, had had their court days many a time. Some ancient trees before the house were still cut into as formal and unnatural as the hoops and wigs and stiff skirts; but their own allotted places in the great procession of the dead were not far off, and they would soon drop into them and go the silent way of the rest.</p>
<pb n="236" id="p236b"/>
<p>A bell with an old voice&mdash;which I dare say in its time had often said to the house, Here is the green farthingale, Here is the diamond-hilted sword, Here are the shoes with red heels and the blue solitaire,&mdash;sounded gravely in the moonlight, and two cherry-coloured maids came fluttering out to receive Estella. The doorway soon absorbed her boxes, and she gave me her hand and a smile, and said good night, and was absorbed likewise. And still I stood looking at the house, thinking how happy I should be if I lived there with her, and knowing that I never was happy with her, but always miserable.</p>
<p>I got into the carriage to be taken back to Hammersmith, and I got in with a bad heart-ache, and I got out with a worse heartache. At our own door, I found little Jane Pocket coming home from a little party escorted by her little lover; and I envied her little lover, in spite of his being subject to Flopson.</p>
<p>Mr. Pocket was out lecturing; for, he was a most delightful lecturer on domestic economy, and his treatises on the management
<pb n="237" id="p237b"/>
of children and servants were considered the very best text-books on those themes. But, Mrs. Pocket was at home, and was in a little difficulty, on account of the baby's having been accommodated with a needlecase to keep him quiet during the unaccountable absence (with a relative in the Foot Guards) of Millers. And more needles were missing, than it could be regarded as quite wholesome for a patient of such tender years either to apply externally or to take as a tonic.</p>
<p>Mr. Pocket being justly celebrated for giving most excellent practical advice, and for having a clear and sound perception of things and a highly judicious mind, I had some notion in my heart-ache of begging him to accept my confidence. But, happening to look up at Mrs. Pocket as she sat reading her book of dignities after prescribing Bed as a sovereign remedy for baby, I thought&mdash;Well&mdash;No, I wouldn't.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter">
<pb n="238" id="p238b"/>
<head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
<p>As I had grown accustomed to my expectations, I had insensibly begun to notice their effect upon myself and those around me. Their influence on my own character, I disguised from my recognition as much as possible, but I knew very well that it was not all good. I lived in a state of chronic uneasiness respecting my behaviour to Joe. My conscience was not by any means comfortable about Biddy. When I woke up in the night&mdash;like Camilla&mdash;I used to think, with a weariness on my spirits, that I should have been happier and better if I had never seen Miss Havisham's face, and had risen to manhood content to be partners with Joe in
<pb n="239" id="p239b"/>
the honest old forge. Many a time of an evening, when I sat alone looking at the fire, I thought, after all there was no fire like the forge fire and the kitchen fire at home.</p>
<p>Yet Estella was so inseparable from all my restlessness and disquiet of mind, that I really fell into confusion as to the limits of my own part in its production. That is to say, supposing I had had no expectations, and yet had had Estella to think of, I could not make out to my satisfaction that I should have done much better. Now, concerning the influence of my position on others, I was in no such difficulty, and so I perceived&mdash;though dimly enough perhaps&mdash;that it was not beneficial to anybody, and, above all, that it was not beneficial to Herbert. My lavish habits led his easy nature into expenses that he could not afford, corrupted the simplicity of his life, and disturbed his peace with anxieties and regrets. I was not at all remorseful for having unwittingly set those other branches of the Pocket family to the poor arts they practised: because such littlenesses were their
<pb n="240" id="p240b"/>
natural bent, and would have been evoked by anybody else, if I had left them slumbering. But Herbert's was a very different case, and it often caused me a twinge to think that I had done him evil service in crowding his sparely - furnished chambers with incongruous upholstery work, and placing the canary-breasted Avenger at his disposal.</p>
<p>So now, as an infallible way of making little ease great ease, I began to contract a quantity of debt. I could hardly begin but Herbert must begin too, so he soon followed. At Startop's suggestion, we put ourselves down for election into a club called The Finches of the Grove: the object of which institution I have never divined, if it were not that the members should dine expensively once a fortnight, to quarrel among themselves as much as possible after dinner, and to cause six waiters to get drunk on the stairs. I know that these gratifying social ends were so invariably accomplished, that Herbert and I understood nothing else to be referred to in the first standing toast of the society: which ran &ldquo;Gentlemen, may
<pb n="241" id="p241b"/>
the present promotion of good feeling ever reign predominant among the Finches of the Grove.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Finches spent their money foolishly (the Hotel we dined at was in Covent-garden), and the first Finch I saw, when I had the honour of joining the Grove, was Bentley Drummle: at that time floundering about town in a cab of his own, and doing a great deal of damage to the posts at the street corners. Occasionally, he shot himself out of his equipage head-foremost over the apron; and I saw him on one occasion deliver himself at the door of the Grove in this unintentional way&mdash;like coals. But here I anticipate a little, for I was not a Finch, and could not be, according to the sacred laws of the society, until I came of age.</p>
<p>In my confidence in my own resources, I would willingly have taken Herbert's expenses on myself; but Herbert was proud, and I could make no such proposal to him. So, he got into difficulties in every direction, and continued to look about him. When we gradually fell into keeping late hours and late company, I noticed that he looked about
<pb n="242" id="p242b"/>
him with a desponding eye at breakfast-time; that he began to look about him more hopefully about mid-day; that he drooped when he came in to dinner; that he seemed to descry Capital in the distance rather clearly, after dinner; that he all but realised Capital towards midnight; and that at about two o'clock in the morning, he became so deeply despondent again as to talk of buying a rifle and going to America, with a general purpose of compelling buffaloes to make his fortune.</p>
<p>I was usually at Hammersmith about half the week, and when I was at Hammersmith I haunted Richmond: whereof separately by-and-by. Herbert would often come to Hammersmith when I was there, and I think at those seasons his father would occasionally have some passing perception that the opening he was looking for, had not appeared yet. But in the general tumbling up of the family, his tumbling out in life somewhere, was a thing to transact itself somehow. In the mean time Mr. Pocket grew greyer, and tried oftener to lift himself out of his perplexities by the hair. While Mrs. Pocket
<pb n="243" id="p243b"/>
tripped up the family with her footstool, read her book of dignities, lost her pocket-handkerchief, told us about her grandpapa, and taught the young idea how to shoot, by shooting it into bed whenever it attracted her notice.</p>
<p>As I am now generalising a period of my life with the object of clearing my way before me, I can scarcely do so better than by at once completing the description of our usual manners and customs at Barnard's Inn.</p>
<p>We spent as much money as we could, and got as little for it as people could make up their minds to give us. We were always more or less miserable, and most of our acquaintance were in the same condition. There was a gay fiction among us that we were constantly enjoying ourselves, and a skeleton truth that we never did. To the best of my belief, our case was in the last aspect a rather common one.</p>
<p>Every morning, with an air ever new, Herbert went into the City to look about him. I often paid him a visit in the dark back-room in which he consorted with an
<pb n="244" id="p244b"/>
ink-jar, a hat-peg, a coal-box, a string-box, an almanack, a desk and stool, and a ruler; and I do not remember that I ever saw him do anything else but look about him. If we all did what we undertake to do, as faithfully as Herbert did, we might live in a Republic of the Virtues. He had nothing else to do, poor fellow, except at a certain hour of every afternoon to &ldquo;go to Lloyd's&rdquo;&mdash;in observance of a ceremony of seeing his principal, I think. He never did anything else in connexion with Lloyd's that I could find out, except come back again. When he felt his case unusually serious, and that he positively must find an opening, he would go on 'Change at a busy time, and walk in and out, in a kind of gloomy country dance figure, among the assembled magnates. &ldquo;For,&rdquo; says Herbert to me, coming home to dinner on one of those special occasions, &ldquo;I find the truth to be, Handel, that an opening won't come to one, but one must go to it&mdash;so I have been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If we had been less attached to one another, I think we must have hated one another regularly every morning. I detested
<pb n="245" id="p245b"/>
the chambers beyond expression at that period of repentance, and could not endure the sight of the Avenger's livery: which had a more expensive and a less remunerative appearance then, than at any other time in the four-and-twenty hours. As we got more and more into debt, breakfast became a hollower and hollower form, and, being on one occasion at breakfast-time threatened (by letter) with legal proceedings, &ldquo;not unwholly unconnected,&rdquo; as my local paper might put it, &ldquo;with jewellery,&rdquo; I went so far as to seize the Avenger by his blue collar and shake him off his feet&mdash;so that he was actually in the air, like a booted Cupid&mdash;for presuming to suppose that we wanted a roll.</p>
<p>At certain times&mdash;meaning at uncertain times, for they depended on our humour&mdash;I would say to Herbert, as if it were a remarkable discovery:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Herbert, we are getting on badly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Handel,&rdquo; Herbert would say to me, in all sincerity, &ldquo;if you will believe me, those very words were on my lips, by a strange coincidence.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="246" id="p246b"/>
<p>&ldquo;Then, Herbert,&rdquo; I would respond, &ldquo;let us look into our affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We always derived profound satisfaction from making an appointment for this purpose. I always thought this was business, this was the way to confront the thing, this was the way to take the foe by the throat. And I know Herbert thought so too.</p>
<p>We ordered something rather special for dinner, with a bottle of something similarly out of the common way, in order that our minds might be fortified for the occasion, and we might come well up to the mark. Dinner over, we produced a bundle of pens, a copious supply of ink, and a goodly show of writing and blotting paper. For, there was something very comfortable in having plenty of stationery.</p>
<p>I would then take a sheet of paper, and write across the top of it, in a neat hand, the heading, &ldquo;Memorandum of Pip's debts;&rdquo; with Barnard's Inn and the date very carefully added. Herbert would also take a sheet of paper, and write across it with similar formalities, &ldquo;Memorandum of Herbert's debts.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="247" id="p247b"/>
<p>Each of us would then refer to a confused heap of papers at his side, which had been thrown into drawers, worn into holes in pockets, half-burnt in lighting candles, stuck for weeks into the looking-glass, and otherwise damaged. The sound of our pens going, refreshed us exceedingly, insomuch that I sometimes found it difficult to distinguish between this edifying business proceeding and actually paying the money. In point of meritorious character, the two things seemed about equal.</p>
<p>When we had written a little while, I would ask Herbert how he got on? Herbert probably would have been scratching his head in a most rueful manner at the sight of his accumulating figures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are mounting up, Handel,&rdquo; Herbert would say; &ldquo;upon my life, they are mounting up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be firm, Herbert,&rdquo; I would retort, plying my own pen with great assiduity. &ldquo;Look the thing in the face. Look into your affairs. Stare them out of countenance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I would, Handel, only they are staring <hi rend="italics">me</hi> out of countenance.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="248" id="p248b"/>
<p>However, my determined manner would have its effect, and Herbert would fall to work again. After a time he would give up once more, on the plea that he had not got Cobbs's bill, or Lobbs's, or Nobbs's, as the case might be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, Herbert, estimate; estimate it in round numbers, and put it down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a fellow of resource you are!&rdquo; my friend would reply, with admiration. &ldquo;Really your business powers are very remarkable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought so too. I established with myself on these occasions, the reputation of a first-rate man of business&mdash;prompt, decisive, energetic, clear, cool-headed. When I had got all my responsibilities down upon my list, I compared each with the bill, and ticked it off. My self-approval when I ticked an entry was quite a luxurious sensation. When I had no more ticks to make, I folded all my bills up uniformly, docketed each on the back, and tied the whole into a symmetrical bundle. Then I did the same for Herbert (who modestly said he had not my administrative genius), and felt that I
<pb n="249" id="p249b"/>
had brought his affairs into a focus for him.</p>
<p>My business habits had one other bright feature, which I called &ldquo;leaving a Margin.&rdquo; For example; supposing Herbert's debts to be one hundred and sixty-four pounds four-and-twopence, I would say, &ldquo;Leave a margin, and put them down at two hundred.&rdquo; Or, supposing my own to be four times as much, I would leave a margin, and put them down at seven hundred. I had the highest opinion of the wisdom of this same Margin, but I am bound to acknowledge that on looking back, I deem it to have been an expensive device. For, we always ran into new debt immediately, to the full extent of the margin, and sometimes in the sense of freedom and solvency it imparted, got pretty far on into another margin.</p>
<p>But there was a calm, a rest, a virtuous hush, consequent on these examinations of our affairs that gave me, for the time, an admirable opinion of myself. Soothed by my exertions, my method, and Herbert's compliments, I would sit with his symmetrical bundle and my own on the table before me
<pb n="250" id="p250b"/>
among the stationery, and feel like a bank of some sort, rather than a private individual.</p>
<p>We shut our outer door on these solemn occasions, in order that we might not be interrupted. I had fallen into my serene state one evening, when we heard a letter dropped through the slit in the said door, and fall on the ground. &ldquo;It's for you, Handel,&rdquo; said Herbert, going out and coming back with it, &ldquo;and I hope there is nothing the matter.&rdquo; This was in allusion to its heavy black seal and border.</p>
<p>The letter was signed TRABB &amp; Co., and its contents were simply, that I was an honoured sir, and that they begged to inform me that Mrs. J. Gargery had departed this life on Monday last, at twenty minutes past six in the evening, and that my attendance was requested at the interment on Monday next at three o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
<p>IT was the first time that a grave had opened in my road of life, and the gap it made in the smooth ground was wonderful. The figure of my sister in her chair by the kitchen fire, haunted me night and day. That the place could possibly be, without her, was something my mind seemed unable to compass; and whereas she had seldom or never been in my thoughts of late, I had now the strangest ideas that she was coming towards me in the street, or that she would presently knock at the door. In my rooms too, with which she had never been at all associated, there was at once the blankness of death and a perpetual suggestion of the
<pb n="252" id="p252b"/>
sound of her voice or the turn of her face or figure, as if she were still alive and had been often there.</p>
<p>Whatever my fortunes might have been, I could scarcely have recalled my sister with much tenderness. But I suppose there is a shock of regret which may exist without much tenderness. Under its influence (and perhaps to make up for the want of the softer feeling) I was seized with a violent indignation against the assailant from whom she had suffered so much; and I felt that on sufficient proof I could have revengefully pursued Orlick, or any one else, to the last extremity.</p>
<p>Having written to Joe, to offer consolation, and to assure him that I should come to the funeral, I passed the intermediate days in the curious state of mind I have glanced at. I went down early in the morning, and alighted at the Blue Boar in good time to walk over to the forge.</p>
<p>It was fine summer weather again, and, as I walked along, the times when I was a little helpless creature, and my sister did not spare me, vividly returned. But they returned
<pb n="253" id="p253b"/>
with a gentle tone upon them that softened even the edge of Tickler. For now, the very breath of the beans and clover whispered to my heart that the day must come when it would be well for my memory that others walking in the sunshine should be softened as they thought of me.</p>
<p>At last I came within sight of the house, and saw that Trabb and Co. had put in a funeral execution and taken possession. Two dismally absurd persons, each ostentatiously exhibiting a crutch done up in a black bandage&mdash;as if that instrument could possibly communicate any comfort to anybody&mdash;were posted at the front door; and in one of them I recognised a postboy discharged from the Boar for turning a young couple into a sawpit on their bridal morning, in consequence of intoxication rendering it necessary for him to ride his horse clasped round the neck with both arms. All the children of the village, and most of the women, were admiring these sable warders and the closed windows of the house and forge; and as I came up, one of the two warders (the postboy) knocked at the door&mdash;implying 
<pb n="254" id="p254b"/>
that I was far too much exhausted by grief, to have strength remaining to knock for myself.</p>
<p>Another sable warder (a carpenter, who had once eaten two geese for a wager) opened the door, and showed me into the best parlour. Here, Mr. Trabb had taken unto himself the best table, and had got all the leaves up, and was holding a kind of black Bazaar, with the aid of a quantity of black pins. At the moment of my arrival, he had just finished putting somebody's hat into black long-clothes, like an African baby; so he held out his hand for mine. But I, misled by the action, and confused by the occasion, shook hands with him with every testimony of warm affection.</p>
<p>Poor dear Joe, entangled in a little black cloak tied in a large bow under his chin, was seated apart at the upper end of the room; where, as chief mourner, he had evidently been stationed by Trabb. When I bent down and said to him, &ldquo;Dear Joe, how are you?&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Pip, old chap, you knowed her when she were a fine figure
<pb n="255" id="p255b"/>
of a&mdash;&rdquo; and clasped my hand and said no more.</p>
<p>Biddy, looking very neat and modest in her black dress, went quietly here and there, and was very helpful. When I had spoken to Biddy, as I thought it not a time for talking I went and sat down near Joe, and there began to wonder in what part of the house it&mdash;she&mdash;my sister&mdash;was. The air of the parlour being faint with the smell of sweet cake, I looked about for the table of refreshments; it was scarcely visible until one had got accustomed to the gloom, but there was a cut-up plum-cake upon it, and there were cut-up oranges, and sandwiches, and biscuits, and two decanters that I knew very well as ornaments, but had never seen used in all my life; one full of port, and one of sherry. Standing at this table, I became conscious of the servile Pumblechook in a black cloak and several yards of hatband, who was alternately stuffing himself, and making obsequious movements to catch my attention. The moment he succeeded, he came over to me (breathing sherry and
<pb n="256" id="p256b"/>
crumbs), and said in a subdued voice, &ldquo;May I, dear sir?&rdquo; and did. I then descried Mr. and Mrs. Hubble; the last-named in a decent speechless paroxysm in a corner. We were all going to &ldquo;follow,&rdquo; and were all in course of being tied up separately (by Trabb) into ridiculous bundles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which I meantersay, Pip,&rdquo; Joe whispered me, as we were being what Mr. Trabb called &ldquo;formed&rdquo; in the parlour, two and two&mdash;and it was dreadfully like a preparation for some grim kind of dance; &ldquo;which I meantersay, sir, as I would in preference have carried her to the church myself, along with three or four friendly ones wot come to it with willing harts and arms, but it were considered wot the neighbours would look down on such and would be of opinions as it were wanting in respect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pocket - handkerchiefs out, all!&rdquo; cried Mr. Trabb at this point, in a depressed business-like voice. &ldquo;Pocket-handkerchiefs out! We are ready!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, we all put our pocket-handkerchiefs to our faces, as if our noses were bleeding, and filed out two and two; Joe and I;
<pb n="257" id="p257b"/>
Biddy and Pumblechook; Mr. and Mrs. Hubble. The remains of my poor sister had been brought round by the kitchen door, and, it being a point of Undertaking ceremony that the six bearers must be stifled and blinded under a horrible black velvet housing with a white border, the whole looked like a blind monster with twelve human legs, shuffling and blundering along, under the guidance of two keepers&mdash;the postboy and his comrade.</p>
<p>The neighbourhood, however, highly approved of these arrangements, and we were much admired as we went through the village; the more youthful and vigorous part of the community making dashes now and then to cut us off, and lying in wait to intercept us at points of vantage. At such times the more exuberant among them called out in an excited manner on our emergence round some corner of expectancy, &ldquo;<hi rend="italics">Here</hi> they come!&rdquo; &ldquo;<hi rend="italics">Here</hi> they are!&rdquo; and we were all but cheered. In this progress I was much annoyed by the abject Pumblechook, who, being behind me, persisted all the way as a delicate attention in arranging
<pb n="258" id="p258b"/>
my streaming hatband, and smoothing my cloak. My thoughts were further distracted by the excessive pride of Mr. and Mrs. Hubble, who were surpassingly conceited and vainglorious in being members of so distinguished a procession.</p>
<p>And now, the range of marshes lay clear before us, with the sails of the ships on the river growing out of it; and we went into the churchyard, close to the graves of my unknown parents, Philip Pirrip, late of this parish, and Also Georgiana, Wife of the Above. And there, my sister was laid quietly in the earth while the larks sang high above it, and the light wind strewed it with beautiful shadows of clouds and trees.</p>
<p>Of the conduct of the worldly-minded Pumblechook while this was doing, I desire to say no more than it was all addressed to me; and that even when those noble passages were read which remind humanity how it brought nothing into the world and can take nothing out, and how it fleeth like a shadow and never continueth long in one stay, I heard him cough a reservation of the case of a young gentleman who came unexpectedly
<pb n="259" id="p259b"/>
into large property. When we got back, he had the hardihood to tell me that he wished my sister could have known I had done her so much honour, and to hint that she would have considered it reasonably purchased at the price of her death. After that, he drank all the rest of the sherry, and Mr. Hubble drank the port, and the two talked (which I have since observed to be customary in such cases) as if they were of quite another race from the deceased, and were notoriously immortal. Finally, he went away with Mr. and Mrs. Hubble&mdash;to make an evening of it, I felt sure, and to tell the Jolly Bargemen that he was the founder of my fortunes and my earliest benefactor.</p>
<p>When they were all gone, and when Trabb and his men&mdash;but not his boy: I looked for him&mdash;had crammed their mummery into bags, and were gone too, the house felt wholesomer. Soon afterwards, Biddy, Joe, and I, had a cold dinner together; but we dined in the best parlour, not in the old kitchen, and Joe was so exceedingly particular what he did with his knife and fork and the salt-cellar and what not, that there
<pb n="260" id="p260b"/>
was great restraint upon us. But after dinner, when I made him take his pipe, and when I had loitered with him about the forge, and when we sat down together on the great block of stone outside it, we got on better. I noticed that after the funeral Joe changed his clothes so far, as to make a compromise between his Sunday dress and working dress: in which the dear fellow looked natural, and like the Man he was.</p>
<p>He was very much pleased by my asking if I might sleep in my own little room, and I was pleased too; for, I felt that I had done rather a great thing in making the request. When the shadows of evening were closing in, I took an opportunity of getting into the garden with Biddy for a little talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Biddy,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I think you might have written to me about these sad matters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you, Mr. Pip?&rdquo; said Biddy. &ldquo;I should have written if I had thought that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't suppose that I mean to be unkind, Biddy, when I say I consider that you ought to have thought that.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="261" id="p261b"/>
<p>&ldquo;Do you, Mr. Pip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was so quiet, and had such an orderly, good, and pretty way with her, that I did not like the thought of making her cry again. After looking a little at her downcast eyes as she walked beside me, I gave up that point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it will be difficult for you to remain here now, Biddy dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I can't do so, Mr. Pip,&rdquo; said Biddy, in a tone of regret, but still of quiet conviction. &ldquo;I have been speaking to Mrs. Hubble, and I am going to her to-morrow. I hope we shall be able to take some care of Mr. Gargery, together, until he settles down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you going to live, Biddy? If you want any mo&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How am I going to live?&rdquo; repeated Biddy, striking in, with a momentary flush upon her face. &ldquo;I'll tell you, Mr. Pip. I am going to try to get the place of mistress in the new school nearly finished here. I can be well recommended by all the neighbours, and I hope I can be industrious and patient, and teach myself while I teach
<pb n="262" id="p262b"/>
others. You know, Mr. Pip,&rdquo; pursued Biddy, with a smile, as she raised her eyes to my face, &ldquo;the new schools are not like the old, but I learnt a good deal from you after that time, and have had time since then to improve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you would always improve, Biddy, under any circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! Except in my bad side of human nature,&rdquo; murmured Biddy.</p>
<p>It was not so much a reproach, as an irresistible thinking aloud. Well! I thought I would give up that point too. So, I walked a little further with Biddy, looking silently at her downcast eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not heard the particulars of my sister's death, Biddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are very slight, poor thing. She had been in one of her bad states&mdash;though they had got better of late, rather than worse&mdash;for four days, when she came out of it in the evening, just at tea-time, and said quite plainly, &lsquo;Joe.&rsquo; As she had never said any word for a long while, I ran and fetched in Mr. Gargery from the forge. She made signs to me that she wanted him
<pb n="263" id="p263b"/>
to sit down close to her, and wanted me to put her arms round his neck. So I put them round his neck, and she laid her head down on his shoulder quite content and satisfied. And so she presently said &lsquo;Joe&rsquo; again, and once &lsquo;Pardon,&rsquo; and once &lsquo;Pip.&rsquo; And so she never lifted her head up any more, and it was just an hour later when we laid it down on her own bed, because we found she was gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biddy cried; the darkening garden, and the lane, and the stars that were coming out, were blurred in my own sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing was ever discovered, Biddy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what is become of Orlick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think from the colour of his clothes that he is working in the quarries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you have seen him then?&mdash;Why are you looking at that dark tree in the lane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw him there, on the night she died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was not the last time either, Biddy?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="264" id="p264b"/>
<p>&ldquo;No; I have seen him there, since we have been walking here.&mdash;It is of no use,&rdquo; said Biddy, laying her hand upon my arm, as I was for running out, &ldquo;you know I would not deceive you; he was not there a minute, and he is gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It revived my utmost indignation to find that she was still pursued by this fellow, and I felt inveterate against him. I told her so, and told her that I would spend any money or take any pains to drive him out of that country. By degrees she led me into more temperate talk, and she told me how Joe loved me, and how Joe never complained of anything&mdash;she didn't say, of me; she had no need; I knew what she meant&mdash;but ever did his duty in his way of life, with a strong hand, a quiet tongue, and a gentle heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, it would be hard to say too much for him,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;and Biddy, we must often speak of these things, for of course I shall be often down here now. I am not going to leave poor Joe alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biddy said never a single word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Biddy, don't you hear me?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="265" id="p265b"/>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Pip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to mention your calling me Mr. Pip&mdash;which appears to me to be in bad taste, Biddy&mdash;what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I mean?&rdquo; asked Biddy, timidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Biddy,&rdquo; said I, in a virtuously self-asserting manner, &ldquo;I must request to know what you mean by this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By this?&rdquo; said Biddy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, don't echo,&rdquo; I retorted. &ldquo;You used not to echo, Biddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Used not!&rdquo; said Biddy. &ldquo;O Mr. Pip! Used!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well! I rather thought I would give up that point too. After another silent turn in the garden, I fell back on the main position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Biddy,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I made a remark respecting my coming down here often, to see Joe, which you received with a marked silence. Have the goodness, Biddy, to tell me why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you quite sure, then, that you WILL come to see him often?&rdquo; asked Biddy, stopping in the narrow garden walk, and looking
<pb n="266" id="p266b"/>
at me under the stars with a clear and honest eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear me!&rdquo; said I, as if I found myself compelled to give up Biddy in despair. &ldquo;This really is a very bad side of human nature! Don't say any more, if you please, Biddy. This shocks me very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For which cogent reason I kept Biddy at a distance during supper, and, when I went up to my own old little room, took as stately a leave of her as I could, in my murmuring soul, deem reconcilable with the churchyard and the event of the day. As often as I was restless in the night, and that was every quarter of an hour, I reflected what an unkindness, what an injury, what an injustice, Biddy had done me.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, I was to go. Early in the morning, I was out, and, looking in, unseen, at one of the wooden windows of the forge. There I stood, for minutes, looking at Joe, already at work with a glow of health and strength upon his face that made it show as if the bright sun of the life in store for him were shining on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by, dear Joe!&mdash;No, don't wipe it
<pb n="267" id="p267b"/>
off&mdash;for God's sake, give me your blackened hand!&mdash;I shall be down soon, and often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never too soon, sir,&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;and never too often, Pip!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biddy was waiting for me at the kitchen door, with a mug of new milk and a crust of bread. &ldquo;Biddy,&rdquo; said I, when I gave her my hand at parting, &ldquo;I am not angry, but I am hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, don't be hurt,&rdquo; she pleaded quite pathetically; &ldquo;let only me be hurt, if I have been ungenerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more, the mists were rising as I walked away. If they disclosed to me, as I suspect they did, that I should not come back, and that Biddy was quite right, all I can say is&mdash;they were quite right too.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
<p>HERBERT and I went on from bad to worse, in the way of increasing our debts, looking into our affairs, leaving Margins, and the like exemplary transactions; and Time went on, whether or no, as he has a way of doing; and I came of age&mdash;in fulfilment of Herbert's prediction, that I should do so before I knew where I was.</p>
<p>Herbert himself had come of age, eight months before me. As he had nothing else than his majority to come into, the event did not make a profound sensation in Barnard's Inn. But we had looked forward to my one-and-twentieth birthday, with a crowd of speculations and anticipations, for we had both considered that my guardian could
<pb n="269" id="p269b"/>
hardly help saying something definite on that occasion.</p>
<p>I had taken care to have it well understood in Little Britain, when my birthday was. On the day before it, I received an official note from Wemmick, informing me that Mr. Jaggers would be glad if I would call upon him at five in the afternoon of the auspicious day. This convinced us that something great was to happen, and threw me into an unusual flutter when I repaired to my guardian's office, a model of punctuality.</p>
<p>In the outer office Wemmick offered me his congratulations, and incidentally rubbed the side of his nose with a folded piece of tissue-paper that I liked the look of. But he said nothing respecting it, and motioned me with a nod into my guardian's room. It was November, and my guardian was standing before his fire leaning his back against the chimney-piece, with his hands under his coat-tails.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Pip,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I must call you Mr. Pip to-day. Congratulations, Mr. Pip.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="270" id="p270b"/>
<p>We shook hands&mdash;he was always a remarkably short shaker&mdash;and I thanked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a chair, Mr. Pip,&rdquo; said my guardian.</p>
<p>As I sat down, and he preserved his attitude and bent his brows at his boots, I felt at a disadvantage, which reminded me of that old time when I had been put upon a tombstone. The two ghastly casts on the shelf were not far from him, and their expression was as if they were making a stupid apoplectic attempt to attend to the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now my young friend,&rdquo; my guardian began, as if I were a witness in the box, &ldquo;I am going to have a word or two with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose,&rdquo; said Mr. Jaggers, bending forward to look at the ground, and then throwing his head back to look at the ceiling, &ldquo;what do you suppose you are living at the rate of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the rate of, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At,&rdquo; repeated Mr. Jaggers, still looking at the ceiling, &ldquo;the&mdash;rate&mdash;of?&rdquo; And then
<pb n="271" id="p271b"/>
looked all round the room, and paused with his pocket-handkerchief in his hand, half way to his nose.</p>
<p>I had looked into my affairs so often, that I had thoroughly destroyed any slight notion I might ever have had of their bearings. Reluctantly, I confessed myself quite unable to answer the question. This reply seemed agreeable to Mr. Jaggers, who said, &ldquo;I thought so!&rdquo; and blew his nose with an air of satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I have asked <hi rend="italics">you</hi> a question, my friend,&rdquo; said Mr. Jaggers. &ldquo;Have you anything to ask <hi rend="italics">me?</hi>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it would be a great relief to me to ask you several questions, sir; but I remember your prohibition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask one,&rdquo; said Mr. Jaggers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is my benefactor to be made known to me to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Ask another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that confidence to be imparted to me soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waive that, a moment,&rdquo; said Mr. Jaggers, &ldquo;and ask another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked about me, but there appeared to
<pb n="272" id="p272b"/>
be now no possible escape from the inquiry, &ldquo;Have&mdash;I&mdash;anything to receive, sir?&rdquo; On that, Mr. Jaggers said, triumphantly, &ldquo;I thought we should come to it!&rdquo; and called to Wemmick to give him that piece of paper. Wemmick appeared, handed it in, and disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Pip,&rdquo; said Mr. Jaggers, &ldquo;attend, if you please. You have been drawing pretty freely here; your name occurs pretty often in Wemmick's cash-book; but you are in debt, of course?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid I must say yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know you must say yes; don't you?&rdquo; said Mr. Jaggers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't ask you what you owe, because you don't know; and if you did know, you wouldn't tell me; you would say less. Yes, yes, my friend,&rdquo; cried Mr. Jaggers, waving his forefinger to stop me, as I made a show of protesting: &ldquo;it's likely enough that you think you wouldn't, but you would. You'll excuse me, but I know better than you. Now, take this piece of paper in your hand.
<pb n="273" id="p273b"/>
You have got it? Very good. Now, unfold it and tell me what it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a bank-note,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;for five hundred pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a bank-note,&rdquo; repeated Mr. Jaggers, &ldquo;for five hundred pounds. And a very handsome sum of money too, I think. You consider it so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could I do otherwise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! But answer the question,&rdquo; said Mr. Jaggers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You consider it, undoubtedly, a handsome sum of money. Now, that handsome sum of money, Pip, is your own. It is a present to you on this day, in earnest of your expectations. And at the rate of that handsome sum of money per annum, and at no higher rate, you are to live until the donor of the whole appears. That is to say, you will now take your money affairs entirely into your own hands, and you will draw from Wemmick one hundred and twenty-five pounds per quarter, until you are in communication with the fountain-head,
<pb n="274" id="p274b"/>
and no longer with the mere agent. As I have told you before, I am the mere agent. I execute my instructions, and I am paid for doing so. I think them injudicious, but I am not paid for giving any opinion on their merits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was beginning to express my gratitude to my benefactor for the great liberality with which I was treated, when Mr. Jaggers stopped me. &ldquo;I am not paid, Pip,&rdquo; said he, coolly, &ldquo;to carry your words to any one;&rdquo; and then gathered up his coat-tails, as he had gathered up the subject, and stood frowning at his boots as if he suspected them of designs against him.</p>
<p>After a pause, I hinted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a question just now, Mr. Jaggers, which you desired me to waive for a moment. I hope I am doing nothing wrong in asking it again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>I might have known that he would never help me out; but it took me aback to have to shape the question afresh, as if it were quite new. &ldquo;Is it likely,&rdquo; I said, after hesitating, &ldquo;that my patron, the fountain-head
<pb n="275" id="p275b"/>
you have spoken of, Mr. Jaggers, will soon&mdash;&rdquo; there I delicately stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will soon what?&rdquo; asked Mr. Jaggers. &ldquo;That's no question as it stands, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will soon come to London,&rdquo; said I, after casting about for a precise form of words, &ldquo;or summon me anywhere else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now here,&rdquo; replied Mr. Jaggers, fixing me for the first time with his dark deep-set eyes, &ldquo;we must revert to the evening when we first encountered one another in your village. What did I tell you then, Pip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You told me, Mr. Jaggers, that it might be years hence when that person appeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said Mr. Jaggers; &ldquo;that's my answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As we looked full at one another, I felt my breath come quicker in my strong desire to get something out of him. And as I felt that it came quicker, and as I felt that he saw that it came quicker, I felt that I had less chance than ever of getting anything out of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose it will still be years hence, Mr. Jaggers?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="276" id="p276b"/>
<p>Mr. Jaggers shook his head&mdash;not in negativing the question, but in altogether negativing the notion that he could anyhow be got to answer it&mdash;and the two horrible casts of the twitched faces looked, when my eyes strayed up to them, as if they had come to a crisis in their suspended attention, and were going to sneeze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; said Mr. Jaggers, warming the backs of his legs with the backs of his warmed hands, &ldquo;I'll be plain with you, my friend Pip. That's a question I must not be asked. You'll understand that, better, when I tell you it's a question that might compromise <hi rend="italics">me.</hi> Come! I'll go a little further with you; I'll say something more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bent down so low to frown at his boots, that he was able to rub the calves of his legs in the pause he made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When that person discloses,&rdquo; said Mr. Jaggers, straightening himself, &ldquo;you and that person will settle your own affairs. When that person discloses, my part in this business will cease and determine. When that person discloses, it will not be necessary for me to know anything about it. And that's all I have got to say.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="277" id="p277b"/>
<p>We looked at one another until I withdrew my eyes, and looked thoughtfully at the floor. From this last speech I derived the notion that Miss Havisham, for some reason or no reason, had not taken him into her confidence as to her designing me for Estella; that he resented this, and felt a jealousy about it; or that he really did object to that scheme, and would have nothing to do with it. When I raised my eyes again, I found that he had been shrewdly looking at me all the time, and was doing so still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that is all you have to say, sir,&rdquo; I remarked, &ldquo;there can be nothing left for me to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded assent, and pulled out his thief-dreaded watch, and asked me where I was going to dine? I replied at my own chambers, with Herbert. As a necessary sequence, I asked him if he would favour us with his company, and he promptly accepted the invitation. But he insisted on walking home with me, in order that I might make no extra preparation for him, and first he had a letter or two to write, and (of course) had his hands to wash. So, I
<pb n="278" id="p278b"/>
said I would go into the outer office and talk to Wemmick.</p>
<p>The fact was, that when the five hundred pounds had come into my pocket, a thought had come into my head which had been often there before; and it appeared to me that Wemmick was a good person to advise with, concerning such thought.</p>
<p>He had already locked up his safe, and made preparations for going home. He had left his desk, brought out his two greasy office candlesticks and stood them in line with the snuffers on a slab near the door, ready to be extinguished; he had raked his fire low, put his hat and great-coat ready, and was beating himself all over the chest with his safe-key, as an athletic exercise after business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Wemmick,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I want to ask your opinion. I am very desirous to serve a friend&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wemmick tightened his post-office and shook his head, as if his opinion were dead against any fatal weakness of that sort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This friend,&rdquo; I pursued, &ldquo;is trying to get on in commercial life, but has no money,
<pb n="279" id="p279b"/>
and finds it difficult and disheartening to make a beginning. Now, I want somehow to help him to a beginning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With money down?&rdquo; said Wemmick, in a tone drier than any sawdust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With <hi rend="italics">some</hi> money down,&rdquo; I replied, for an uneasy remembrance shot across me of that symmetrical bundle of papers at home; &ldquo;with <hi rend="italics">some</hi> money down, and perhaps some anticipation of my expectations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Pip,&rdquo; said Wemmick, &ldquo;I should like just to run over with you on my fingers, if you please, the names of the various bridges up as high as Chelsea Reach. Let's see; there's London, one; Southwark, two; Blackfriars, three; Waterloo; four; Westminster, five; Vauxhall, six.&rdquo; He had checked off each bridge in its turn, with the handle of his safe-key on the palm of his hand. &ldquo;There's as many as six, you see, to choose from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't understand you,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Choose your bridge, Mr. Pip,&rdquo; returned Wemmick, &ldquo;and take a walk upon your bridge, and pitch your money into the Thames over the centre arch of your bridge,
<pb n="280" id="p280b"/>
and you know the end of it. Serve a friend with it, and you may know the end of it too&mdash;but it's a less pleasant and profitable end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could have posted a newspaper in his mouth, he made it so wide after saying this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is very discouraging,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meant to be so,&rdquo; said Wemmick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then is it your opinion,&rdquo; I inquired, with some little indignation, &ldquo;that a man should never&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;Invest portable property in a friend?&rdquo; said Wemmick. &ldquo;Certainly he should not. Unless he wants to get rid of the friend&mdash;and then it becomes a question how much portable property it may be worth to get rid of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;is your deliberate opinion, Mr. Wemmick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; he returned, &ldquo;is my deliberate opinion in this office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said I, pressing him, for I thought I saw him near a loophole here; &ldquo;but would that be your opinion at Walworth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Pip,&rdquo; he replied, with gravity,
<pb n="281" id="p281b"/>
&ldquo;Walworth is one place, and this office is another. Much as the Aged is one person, and Mr. Jaggers is another. They must not be confounded together. My Walworth sentiments must be taken at Walworth; none but my official sentiments can be taken in this office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said I, much relieved, &ldquo;then I shall look you up at Walworth, you may depend upon it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Pip,&rdquo; he returned, &ldquo;you will be welcome there, in a private and personal capacity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had held this conversation in a low voice, well knowing my guardians ears to be the sharpest of the sharp. As he now appeared in his doorway, towelling his hands, Wemmick got on his great-coat and stood by to snuff out the candles. We all three went into the street together, and from the door-step Wemmick turned his way, and Mr. Jaggers and I turned ours.</p>
<p>I could not help wishing more than once that evening, that Mr. Jaggers had had an Aged in Gerrard-street, or a Stinger, or a Something, or a Somebody, to unbend his
<pb n="282" id="p282b"/>
brows a little. It was an uncomfortable consideration on a twenty-first birthday, that coming of age at all seemed hardly worth while in such a guarded and suspicious world as he made of it. He was a thousand times better informed and cleverer than Wemmick, and yet I would a thousand times rather have had Wemmick to dinner. And Mr. Jaggers made not me alone intensely melancholy, because, after he was gone, Herbert said of himself, with his eyes fixed on the fire, that he thought he must have committed a felony and forgotten the details of it, he felt so dejected and guilty.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
<p>DEEMING Sunday the best day for taking Mr. Wemmick's Walworth sentiments, I devoted the next ensuing Sunday afternoon to a pilgrimage to the Castle. On arriving before the battlements, I found the Union Jack flying and the drawbridge up; but undeterred by this show of defiance and resistance, I rang at the gate, and was admitted in a most pacific manner by the Aged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son, sir,&rdquo; said the old man, after securing the drawbridge, &ldquo;rather had it in his mind that you might happen to drop in, and he left word that he would soon be home from his afternoon's walk. He is
<pb n="284" id="p284b"/>
very regular in his walks, is my son. Very regular in everything, is my son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded at the old gentleman as Wemmick himself might have nodded, and we went in and sat down by the fireside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You made acquaintance with my son, sir,&rdquo; said the old man, in his chirping way, while he warmed his hands at the blaze, &ldquo;at his office, I expect?&rdquo; I nodded. &ldquo;Hah! I have heerd that my son is a wonderful hand at his business, sir?&rdquo; I nodded hard. &ldquo;Yes; so they tell me. His business is the Law?&rdquo; I nodded harder. &ldquo;Which makes it more surprising in my son,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;for he was not brought up to the Law, but to the Wine-Coopering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curious to know how the old gentleman stood informed concerning the reputation of Mr. Jaggers, I roared that name at him. He threw me into the greatest confusion by laughing heartily and replying in a very sprightly manner, &ldquo;No, to be sure; you're right.&rdquo; And to this hour I have not the faintest notion what he meant, or what joke he thought I had made.</p>
<pb n="285" id="p285b"/>
<p>As I could not sit there nodding at him perpetually, without making some other attempt to interest him, I shouted an inquiry whether his own calling in life had been &ldquo;the Wine-Coopering.&rdquo; By dint of straining that term out of myself several times and tapping the old gentleman on the chest to associate it with him, I at last succeeded in making my meaning understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the old gentleman; &ldquo;the warehousing, the warehousing. First, over yonder;&rdquo; he appeared to mean up the chimney, but I believe he intended to refer me to Liverpool; &ldquo;and then in the City of London here. However, having an infirmity&mdash;for I am hard of hearing, sir&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I expressed in pantomime the greatest astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;Yes, hard of hearing; having that infirmity coming upon me, my son he went into the Law, and he took charge of me, and he by little and little made out this elegant and beautiful property. But returning to what you said, you know,&rdquo; pursued the old man, again laughing heartily,
<pb n="286" id="p286b"/>
&ldquo;what I say is, No to be sure; you're right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was modestly wondering whether my utmost ingenuity would have enabled me to say anything that would have amused him half as much as this imaginary pleasantry, when I was startled by a sudden click in the wall on one side of the chimney, and the ghostly tumbling open of a little wooden flap with &ldquo;JOHN&rdquo; upon it. The old man, following my eyes, cried with great triumph, &ldquo;My son's come home!&rdquo; and we both went out to the drawbridge.</p>
<p>It was worth any money to see Wemmick waving a salute to me from the other side of the moat, when we might have shaken hands across it with the greatest ease. The Aged was so delighted to work the drawbridge, that I made no offer to assist him, but stood quiet until Wemmick had come across, and had presented me to Miss Skiffins: a lady by whom he was accompanied.</p>
<p>Miss Skiffins was of a wooden appearance, and was, like her escort, in the post-office branch of the service. She might have been
<pb n="287" id="p287b"/>
some two or three years younger that Wemmick, and I judged her to stand possessed of portable property. The cut of her dress from the waist upward, both before and behind, made her figure very like a boy's kite; and I might have pronounced her gown a little too decidedly orange, and her gloves a little too intensely green. But she seemed to be a good sort of fellow, and showed a high regard for the Aged. I was not long in discovering that she was a frequent visitor at the Castle; for, on our going in, and my complimenting Wemmick on his ingenious contrivance for announcing himself to the Aged, he begged me to give my attention for a moment to the other side of the chimney, and disappeared. Presently another click came, and another little door tumbled open with &ldquo;Miss Skiffins&rdquo; on it; then Miss Skiffins shut up and John tumbled open; then Miss Skiffins and John both tumbled open together, and finally shut up together. On Wemmick's return from working these mechanical appliances, I expressed the great admiration with which I regarded them, and he said, &ldquo;Well, you know, they're both pleasant and
<pb n="288" id="p288b"/>
useful to the Aged. And by George, sir, it's a thing worth mentioning, that of all the people who come to this gate, the secret of those pulls is only known to the Aged, Miss Skiffins, and me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Mr. Wemmick made them,&rdquo; added Miss Skiffins, &ldquo;with his own hands out of his own head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Miss Skiffins was taking off her bonnet (she retained her green gloves during the evening as an outward and visible sign that there was company), Wemmick invited me to take a walk with him round the property, and see how the island looked in winter-time. Thinking that he did this to give me an opportunity of taking his Walworth sentiments, I seized the opportunity as soon as we were out of the Castle.</p>
<p>Having thought of the matter with care, I approached my subject as if I had never hinted at it before. I informed Wemmick that I was anxious in behalf of Herbert Pocket, and I told him how we had first met, and how we had fought. I glanced at Herbert's home, and at his character, and at his having no means but such as he was dependent
<pb n="289" id="p289b"/>
on his father for: those, uncertain and unpunctual. I alluded to the advantages I had derived in my first rawness and ignorance from his society, and I confessed that I feared I had but ill repaid them, and that he might have done better without me and my expectations. Keeping Miss Havisham in the background at a great distance, I still hinted at the possibility of my having competed with him in his prospects, and at the certainty of his possessing a generous soul, and being far above any mean distrusts, retaliations, or designs. For all these reasons (I told Wemmick), and because he was my young companion and friend, and I had a great affection for him, I wished my own good fortune to reflect some rays upon him, and therefore I sought advice from Wemmick's experience and knowledge of men and affairs, how I could best try with my resources to help Herbert to some present income&mdash;say of a hundred a year, to keep him in good hope and heart&mdash;and gradually to buy him on to some small partnership. I begged Wemmick, in conclusion, to understand that my help must always be rendered
<pb n="290" id="p290b"/>
without Herbert's knowledge or suspicion, and that there was no one else in the world with whom I could advise. I wound up by laying my hand upon his shoulder, and saying, &ldquo;I can't help confiding in you, though I know it must be troublesome to you; but that is your fault, in having ever brought me here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wemmick was silent for a little while, and then said with a kind of start, &ldquo;Well you know, Mr. Pip, I must tell you one thing. This is devilish good of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say you'll help me to be good then,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ecod,&rdquo; replied Wemmick, shaking his head, &ldquo;that's not my trade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor is this your trading-place,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;You hit the nail on the head. Mr. Pip, I'll put on my considering-cap, and I think all you want to do, may be done by degrees. Skiffins (that's her brother) is an accountant and agent. I'll look him up and go to work for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you ten thousand times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I thank
<pb n="291" id="p291b"/>
you, for though we are strictly in our private and personal capacity, still it may be mentioned that there <hi rend="italics">are</hi> Newgate cobwebs about, and it brushes them away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a little further conversation to the same effect, we returned into the Castle where we found Miss Skiffins preparing tea. The responsible duty of making the toast was delegated to the Aged, and that excellent old gentleman was so intent upon it that he seemed to me in some danger of melting his eyes. It was no nominal meal that we were going to make, but a vigorous reality. The Aged prepared such a haystack of buttered toast, that I could scarcely see him over it as it simmered on an iron stand hooked on to the top-bar; while Miss Skiffins brewed such a jorum of tea, that the pig in the back premises became strongly excited, and repeatedly expressed his desire to participate in the entertainment.</p>
<p>The flag had been struck, and the gun had been fired, at the right moment of time, and I felt as snugly cut off from the rest of Walworth as if the moat were thirty feet wide by as many deep. Nothing disturbed the
<pb n="292" id="p292b"/>
tranquillity of the Castle, but the occasional tumbling open of John and Miss Skiffins: which little doors were a prey to some spasmodic infirmity that made me sympathetically uncomfortable until I got used to it. I inferred from the methodical nature of Miss Skiffins's arrangements that she made tea there every Sunday night; and I rather suspected that a classic brooch she wore, representing the profile of an undesirable female with a very straight nose and a very new moon, was a piece of portable property that had been given her by Wemmick.</p>
<p>We ate the whole of the toast, and drank tea in proportion, and it was delightful to see how warm and greasy we all got after it. The Aged especially, might have passed for some clean old chief of a savage tribe, just oiled. After a short pause of repose, Miss Skiffins&mdash;in the absence of the little servant who, it seemed, retired to the bosom of her family on Sunday afternoons&mdash;washed up the tea-things, in a trifling lady-like amateur manner that compromised none of us. Then, she put on her gloves again, and we drew
<pb n="293" id="p293b"/>
round the fire, and Wemmick said, &ldquo;Now Aged Parent, tip us the paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wemmick explained to me while the Aged got his spectacles out, that this was according to custom, and that it gave the old gentleman infinite satisfaction to read the news aloud. &ldquo;I won't offer an apology,&rdquo; said Wemmick, &ldquo;for he isn't capable of many pleasures&mdash;are you, Aged P.?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, John, all right,&rdquo; returned the old man, seeing himself spoken to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only tip him a nod every now and then when he looks off his paper,&rdquo; said Wemmick, &ldquo;and he'll be as happy as a king. We are all attention, Aged One.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, John, all right!&rdquo; returned the cheerful old man: so busy and so pleased, that it really was quite charming.</p>
<p>The Aged's reading reminded me of the classes at Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt's, with the pleasanter peculiarity that it seemed to come through a keyhole. As he wanted the candles close to him, and as he was always on the verge of putting either his head or the newspaper into them, he required
<pb n="294" id="p294b"/>
as much watching as a powder-mill. But Wemmick was equally untiring and gentle in his vigilance, and the Aged read on, quite unconscious of his many rescues. Whenever he looked at us, we all expressed the greatest interest and amazement, and nodded until he resumed again.</p>
<p>As Wemmick and Miss Skiffins sat side by side, and as I sat in a shadowy corner, I observed a slow and gradual elongation of Mr. Wemmick's mouth, powerfully suggestive of his slowly and gradually stealing his arm round Miss Skiffins's waist. In course of time I saw his hand appear on the other side of Miss Skiffins; but at that moment Miss Skiffins neatly stopped him with the green glove, unwound his arm again as if it were an article of dress, and with the greatest deliberation laid it on the table before her. Miss Skiffins's composure while she did this was one of the most remarkable sights I have ever seen, and if I could have thought the act consistent with abstraction of mind, I should have deemed that Miss Skiffins performed it mechanically.</p>
<p>By-and-by, I noticed Wemmick's arm beginning
<pb n="295" id="p295b"/>
to disappear again, and gradually fading out of view. Shortly afterwards, his mouth began to widen again. After an interval of suspense on my part that was quite enthralling and almost painful, I saw his hand appear on the other side of Miss Skiffins. Instantly, Miss Skiffins stopped it with the neatness of a placid boxer, took off that girdle or cestus as before, and laid it on the table. Taking the table to represent the path of virtue, I am justified in stating that during the whole time of the Aged's reading, Wemmick's arm was straying from the path of virtue and being recalled to it by Miss Skiffins.</p>
<p>At last, the Aged read himself into a light slumber. This was the time for Wemmick to produce a little kettle, a tray of glasses, and a black bottle with a porcelain-topped cork, representing some clerical dignitary of a rubicund and social aspect. With the aid of these appliances we all had something warm to drink: including the Aged, who was soon awake again. Miss Skiffins mixed, and I observed that she and Wemmick drank out of one glass. Of course I knew better
<pb n="296" id="p296b"/>
than to offer to see Miss Skiffins home, and under the circumstances I thought I had best go first: which I did, taking a cordial leave of the Aged, and having passed a pleasant evening.</p>
<p>Before a week was out, I received a note from Wemmick, dated Walworth, stating that he hoped he had made some advance in that matter appertaining to our private and personal capacities, and that he would be glad if I could come and see him again upon it. So, I went out to Walworth again, and yet again, and yet again, and I saw him by appointment in the City several times, but never held any communication with him on the subject in or near Little Britain. The upshot was, that we found a worthy young merchant or shipping-broker, not long established in business, who wanted intelligent help, and who wanted capital, and who in due course of time and receipt would want a partner. Between him and me, secret articles were signed of which Herbert was the subject, and I paid him half of my five hundred pounds down, and engaged for sundry other payments: some, to fall due
<pb n="297" id="p297b"/>
at certain dates out of my income: some, contingent on my coming into my property. Miss Skiffins's brother conducted the negotiation. Wemmick pervaded it throughout, but never appeared in it.</p>
<p>The whole business was so cleverly managed, that Herbert had not the least suspicion of my hand being in it. I never shall forget the radiant face with which he came home one afternoon, and told me, as a mighty piece of news, of his having fallen in with one Clarriker (the young merchant's name), and of Clarriker's having shown an extraordinary inclination towards him, and of his belief that the opening had come at last. Day by day as his hopes grew stronger and his face brighter, he must have thought me a more and more affectionate friend, for I had the greatest difficulty in restraining my tears of triumph when I saw him so happy. At length, the thing being done, and he having that day entered Clarriker's House, and he having talked to me for a whole evening in a flush of pleasure and success, I did really cry in good earnest when I went to bed, to think that my expectations
<pb n="298" id="p298b"/>
had done some good to somebody.</p>
<p>A great event in my life, the turning point of my life, now opens on my view. But, before I proceed to narrate it, and before I pass on to all the changes it involved, I must give one chapter to Estella. It is not much to give to the theme that so long filled my heart.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter">
<pb n="299" id="p299b"/>
<head>CHAPTER XIX.</head>
<p>IF that staid old house near the Green at Richmond should ever come to be haunted when I am dead, it will be haunted, surely, by my ghost. O the many, many nights and days through which the unquiet spirit within me haunted that house when Estella lived there! Let my body be where it would, my spirit was always wandering, wandering, wandering, about that house.</p>
<p>The lady with whom Estella was placed, Mrs. Brandley by name, was a widow, with one daughter several years older than Estella. The mother looked young, and the daughter looked old; the mother's complexion was pink, and the daughter's was
<pb n="300" id="p300b"/>
yellow; the mother set up for frivolity, and the daughter for theology. They were in what is called a good position, and visited, and were visited by, numbers of people. Little, if any, community of feeling subsisted between them and Estella, but the understanding was established that they were necessary to her, and that she was necessary to them. Mrs. Brandley had been a friend of Miss Havisham's before the time of her seclusion.</p>
<p>In Mrs. Brandley's house and out of Mrs. Brandley's house, I suffered every kind and degree of torture that Estella could cause me. The nature of my relations with her, which placed me on terms of familiarity without placing me on terms of favour, conduced to my distraction. She made use of me to tease other admirers, and she turned the very familiarity between herself and me, to the account of putting a constant slight on my devotion to her. If I had been her secretary, steward, half-brother, poor relation&mdash;if I had been a younger brother of her appointed husband&mdash;I could not have seemed to myself, further from my
<pb n="301" id="p301b"/>
hopes when I was nearest to her. The privilege of calling her by her name and hearing her call me by mine, became under the circumstances an aggravation of my trials; and while I think it likely that it almost maddened her other lovers, I know too certainly that it almost maddened me.</p>
<p>She had admirers without end. No doubt my jealousy made an admirer of every one who went near her; but there were more than enough of them without that.</p>
<p>I saw her often at Richmond, I heard of her often in town, and I used often to take her and the Brandleys on the water; there were pic-nics, f&ecirc;te days, plays, operas, concerts, parties, all sorts of pleasures, through which I pursued her&mdash;and they were all miseries to me. I never had one hour's happiness in her society, and yet my mind all round the four-and-twenty hours was harping on the happiness of having her with me unto death.</p>
<p>Throughout this part of our intercourse&mdash;and it lasted, as will presently be seen, for what I then thought a long time&mdash;she habitually reverted to that tone which expressed
<pb n="302" id="p302b"/>
that our association was forced upon us. There were other times when she would come to a sudden check in this tone and in all her many tones, and would seem to pity me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pip, Pip,&rdquo; she said one evening, coming to such a check, when we sat apart at a darkening window of the house in Richmond; &ldquo;will you never take warning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Warning not to be attracted by you, do you mean, Estella?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I mean! If you don't know what I mean, you are blind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I should have replied that Love was commonly reputed blind, but for the reason that I always was restrained&mdash;and this was not the least of my miseries&mdash;by a feeling that it was ungenerous to press myself upon her, when she knew that she could not choose but obey Miss Havisham. My dread always was, that this knowledge on her part laid me under a heavy disadvantage with her pride, and made me the subject of a rebellious struggle in her bosom.</p>
<pb n="303" id="p303b"/>
<p>&ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I have no warning given me just now, for you wrote to me to come to you, this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's true,&rdquo; said Estella, with a cold careless smile that always chilled me.</p>
<p>After looking at the twilight without, for a little while, she went on to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The time has come round when Miss Havisham wishes to have me for a day at Satis. You are to take me there, and bring me back, if you will. She would rather I did not travel alone, and objects to receiving my maid, for she has a sensitive horror of being talked of by such people. Can you take me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I take you, Estella!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can then? The day after to-morrow, if you please. You are to pay all charges out of my purse. You hear the condition of your going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And must obey,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>This was all the preparation I received for that visit, or for others like it: Miss Havisham never wrote to me, nor had I ever so much as seen her handwriting. We went down on the next day but one, and
<pb n="304" id="p304b"/>
we found her in the room where I had first beheld her, and it is needless to add that there was no change in Satis House.</p>
<p>She was even more dreadfully fond of Estella than she had been when I last saw them together; I repeat the word advisedly, for there was something positively dreadful in the energy of her looks and embraces. She hung upon Estella's beauty, hung upon her words, hung upon her gestures, and sat mumbling her own trembling fingers while she looked at her, as though she were devouring the beautiful creature she had reared.</p>
<p>From Estella she looked at me, with a searching glance that seemed to pry into my heart and probe its wounds. &ldquo;How does she use you, Pip; how does she use you?&rdquo; she asked me again, with her witch-like eagerness, even in Estella's hearing. But, when we sat by her flickering fire at night, she was most weird; for then, keeping Estella's hand drawn through her arm and clutched in her own hand, she extorted from her, by dint of referring back to what Estella had told her in her regular letters,
<pb n="305" id="p305b"/>
the names and conditions of the men whom she had fascinated; and as Miss Havisham dwelt upon this roll, with the intensity of a mind mortally hurt and diseased, she sat with her other hand on her crutch stick, and her chin on that, and her wan bright eyes glaring at me, a very spectre.</p>
<p>I saw in this, wretched though it made me, and bitter the sense of dependence and even of degradation that it awakened&mdash;I saw in this, that Estella was set to wreak Miss Havisham's revenge on men, and that she was not to be given to me until she had gratified it for a term. I saw in this, a reason for her being beforehand assigned to me. Sending her out to attract and torment and do mischief, Miss Havisham sent her with the malicious assurance that she was beyond the reach of all admirers, and that all who staked upon that cast were secured to lose. I saw in this, that I, too, was tormented by a perversion of ingenuity, even while the prize was reserved for me. I saw in this, the reason for my being staved off so long, and the reason for my
<pb n="306" id="p306b"/>
late guardian's declining to commit himself to the formal knowledge of such a scheme. In a word, I saw in this, Miss Havisham as I had her then and there before my eyes, and always had had her before my eyes; and I saw in this, the distinct shadow of the darkened and unhealthy house in which her life was hidden from the sun.</p>
<p>The candles that lighted that room of hers were placed in sconces on the wall. They were high from the ground, and they burnt with the steady dulness of artificial light in air that is seldom renewed. As I looked round at them, and at the pale gloom they made, and at the stopped clock, and at the withered articles of bridal dress upon the table and the ground, and at her own awful figure with its ghostly reflection thrown large by the fire upon the ceiling and the wall, I saw in everything the construction that my mind had come to, repeated and thrown back to me. My thoughts passed into the great room across the landing where the table was spread, and I saw it written, as it were, in the falls of the cobwebs from the centre-piece, in the
<pb n="307" id="p307b"/>
crawlings of the spiders on the cloth, in the tracks of the mice as they betook their little quickened hearts behind the panels, and in the gropings and pausings of the beetles on the floor.</p>
<p>It happened on the occasion of this visit that some sharp words arose between Estella and Miss Havisham. It was the first time I had ever seen them opposed.</p>
<p>We were seated by the fire, as just now described, and Miss Havisham still had Estella's arm drawn through her own, and still clutched Estella's hand in hers, when Estella gradually began to detach herself. She had shown a proud impatience more than once before, and had rather endured that fierce affection than accepted or returned it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Miss Havisham, flashing her eyes upon her, &ldquo;are you tired of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a little tired of myself,&rdquo; replied Estella, disengaging her arm, and moving to the great chimney-piece, where she stood looking down at the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak the truth, you ingrate!&rdquo; cried Miss Havisham, passionately striking her
<pb n="308" id="p308b"/>
stick upon the floor; &ldquo;you are tired of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Estella looked at her with perfect composure, and again looked down at the fire. Her graceful figure and her beautiful face expressed a self-possessed indifference to the wild heat of the other, that was almost cruel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You stock and stone!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Havisham. &ldquo;You cold, cold heart!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Estella, preserving her attitude of indifference as she leaned against the great chimney-piece and only moving her eyes; &ldquo;do you reproach me for being cold? You?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you not?&rdquo; was the fierce retort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should know,&rdquo; said Estella. &ldquo;I am what you have made me. Take all the praise, take all the blame; take all the success, take all the failure; in short, take me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, look at her, look at her!&rdquo; cried Miss Havisham, bitterly. &ldquo;Look at her, so hard and thankless, on the hearth where she was reared! Where I took her into this wretched breast when it was first bleeding
<pb n="309" id="p309b"/>
from its stabs, and where I have lavished years of tenderness upon her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least I was no party to the compact,&rdquo; said Estella, &ldquo;for if I could walk and speak, when it was made, it was as much as I could do. But what would you have? You have been very good to me, and I owe everything to you. What would you have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love,&rdquo; replied the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not,&rdquo; said Miss Havisham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother by adoption,&rdquo; retorted Estella, never departing from the easy grace of her attitude, never raising her voice as the other did, never yielding either to anger or tenderness, &ldquo;Mother by adoption, I have said that I owe everything to you. All I possess is freely yours. All that you have given me, is at your command to have again. Beyond that, I have nothing. And if you ask me to give you what you never gave me, my gratitude and duty cannot do impossibilities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I never give her, love!&rdquo; cried Miss Havisham, turning wildly to me. &ldquo;Did I
<pb n="310" id="p310b"/>
never give her a burning love, inseparable from jealousy at all times, and from sharp pain, while she speaks thus to me! Let her call me mad, let her call me mad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I call you mad,&rdquo; returned Estella, &ldquo;I, of all people? Does any one live, who knows what set purposes you have, half as well as I do? Does any one live, who knows what a steady memory you have, half as well as I do? I who have sat on this same hearth on the little stool that is even now beside you there, learning your lessons and looking up into your face, when your face was strange and frightened me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon forgotten!&rdquo; moaned Miss Havisham. &ldquo;Times soon forgotten!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not forgotten,&rdquo; retorted Estella. &ldquo;Not forgotten, but treasured up in my memory. When have you found me false to your teaching? When have you found me unmindful of your lessons? When have you found me giving admission here,&rdquo; she touched her bosom with her hand, &ldquo;to anything that you excluded? Be just to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So proud, so proud!&rdquo; moaned Miss Havisham,
<pb n="311" id="p311b"/>
pushing away her grey hair with both her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who taught me to be proud?&rdquo; returned Estella. &ldquo;Who praised me when I learnt my lesson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So hard, so hard!&rdquo; moaned Miss Havisham, with her former action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who taught me to be hard?&rdquo; returned Estella. &ldquo;Who praised me when I learnt my lesson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But to be proud and hard to <hi rend="italics">me!</hi>&rdquo; Miss Havisham quite shrieked, as she stretched out her arms. &ldquo;Estella, Estella, Estella, to be proud and hard to <hi rend="italics">me!</hi>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Estella looked at her for a moment with a kind of calm wonder, but was not otherwise disturbed; when the moment was past, she looked down at the fire again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot think,&rdquo; said Estella, raising her eyes after a silence, &ldquo;why you should be so unreasonable when I come to see you after a separation. I have never forgotten your wrongs and their causes. I have never been unfaithful to you or your schooling. I have never shown any weakness that I can charge myself with.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="312" id="p312b"/>
<p>&ldquo;Would it be weakness to return my love?&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Havisham. &ldquo;But yes, yes, she would call it so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I begin to think,&rdquo; said Estella, in a musing way, after another moment of calm wonder, &ldquo;that I almost understand how this comes about. If you had brought up your adopted daughter wholly in the dark confinement of these rooms, and had never let her know that there was such a thing as the daylight by which she has never once seen your face&mdash;if you had done that, and then, for a purpose had wanted her to understand the daylight and know all about it, you would have been disappointed and angry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Havisham, with her head in her hands, sat making a low moaning, and swaying herself on her chair, but gave no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or,&rdquo; said Estella, &ldquo;&mdash;which is a nearer case&mdash;if you had taught her, from the dawn of her intelligence, with your utmost energy and might, that there was such a thing as daylight, but that it was made to be her enemy and destroyer, and she must always turn against it, for it had blighted you and
<pb n="313" id="p313b"/>
would else blight her;&mdash;if you had done this, and then, for a purpose, had wanted her to take naturally to the daylight and she could not do it, you would have been disappointed and angry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Havisham sat listening (or it seemed so, for I could not see her face), but still made no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; said Estella, &ldquo;I must be taken as I have been made. The success is not mine, the failure is not mine, but the two together make me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Havisham had settled down, I hardly knew how, upon the floor, among the faded bridal relics with which it was strewn. I took advantage of the moment&mdash;I had sought one from the first&mdash;to leave the room, after beseeching Estella's attention to her, with a movement of my hand. When I left, Estella was yet standing by the great chimney-piece, just as she had stood throughout. Miss Havisham's grey hair was all adrift upon the ground, among the other bridal wrecks, and was a miserable sight to see.</p>
<p>It was with a depressed heart that I
<pb n="314" id="p314b"/>
walked in the starlight for an hour and more, about the court-yard, and about the brewery, and about the ruined garden. When I at last took courage to return to the room, I found Estella sitting at Miss Havisham's knee, taking up some stitches in one of those old articles of dress that were dropping to pieces, and of which I have often been reminded since by the faded tatters of old banners that I have seen hanging up in cathedrals. Afterwards, Estella and I played cards, as of yore&mdash;only we were skilful now, and played French games&mdash;and so the evening wore away, and I went to bed.</p>
<p>I lay in that separate building across the court-yard. It was the first time I had ever lain down to rest in Satis House, and sleep refused to come near me. A thousand Miss Havishams haunted me. She was on this side of my pillar, on that, at the head of the bed, at the foot, behind the half-opened door of the dressing-room, in the dressing-room, in the room overhead, in the room beneath&mdash;everywhere. At last, when the night was slow to creep on towards two o'clock, I felt
<pb n="315" id="p315b"/>
that I absolutely could no longer bear the place as a place to lie down in, and that I must get up. I therefore got up and put on my clothes, and went out across the yard into the long stone passage, designing to gain the outer court-yard and walk there for the relief of my mind. But, I was no sooner in the passage than I extinguished my candle; for, I saw Miss Havisham going along it in a ghostly manner, making a low cry. I followed her at a distance, and saw her go up the staircase. She carried a bare candle in her hand, which she had probably taken from one of the sconces in her own room, and was a most unearthly object by its light. Standing at the bottom of the staircase, I felt the mildewed air of the feast-chamber, without seeing her open the door, and I heard her walking there, and so across into her own room, and so across again into that, never ceasing the low cry. After a time, I tried in the dark both to get out, and to go back, but I could do neither until some streaks of day strayed in and showed me where to lay my hands. During the whole interval, whenever I went to the
<pb n="316" id="p316b"/>
bottom of the staircase, I heard her footstep, saw her light pass above, and heard her ceaseless low cry.</p>
<p>Before we left next day, there was no revival of the difference between her and Estella, nor was it ever revived on any similar occasion; and there were four similar occasions, to the best of my remembrance. Nor, did Miss Havisham's manner towards Estella in anywise change, except that I believed it to have something like fear infused among its former characteristics.</p>
<p>It is impossible to turn this leaf of my life, without putting Bentley Drummle's name upon it; or I would, very gladly.</p>
<p>On a certain occasion when the Finches were assembled in force, and when good feeling was being promoted in the usual manner by nobody's agreeing with anybody else, the presiding Finch called the Grove to order, forasmuch as Mr. Drummle had not yet toasted a lady; which, according to the solemn constitution of the society, it was the brute's turn to do that day. I thought I saw him leer in an ugly way at me while the decanters were going round,
<pb n="317" id="p317b"/>
but as there was no love lost between us, that might easily be. What was my indignant surprise when he called upon the company to pledge him to &ldquo;Estella&rdquo;!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Estella who?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never you mind,&rdquo; retorted Drummle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Estella of where?&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;You are bound to say of where.&rdquo; Which he was, as a Finch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of Richmond, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Drummle, putting me out of the question, &ldquo;and a peerless beauty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much he knew about peerless beauties, a mean miserable idiot! I whispered Herbert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that lady,&rdquo; said Herbert, across the table, when the toast had been honoured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italics">Do</hi> you?&rdquo; said Drummle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so do I,&rdquo; I added, with a scarlet face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italics">Do</hi> you?&rdquo; said Drummle. &ldquo;<hi rend="italics">Oh,</hi> Lord!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the only retort&mdash;except glass or crockery&mdash;that the heavy creature was capable of making; but, I became as highly incensed by it as if it had been barbed with wit, and I immediately rose in my place and said that I could not but regard it as being like the
<pb n="318" id="p318b"/>
honourable Finch's impudence to come down to that Grove&mdash;we always talked about coming down to that Grove, as a neat Parliamentary turn of expression&mdash;down to that Grove, proposing a lady of whom he knew nothing. Mr. Drummle upon this, starting up, demanded what I meant by that? Whereupon, I made him the extreme reply that I believed he knew where I was to be found.</p>
<p>Whether it was possible in a Christian country to get on without blood, after this, was a question on which the Finches were divided. The debate upon it grew so lively, indeed, that at least six more honourable members told six more, during the discussion, that they believed <hi rend="italics">they</hi> knew where <hi rend="italics">they</hi> were to be found. However, it was decided at last (the Grove being a Court of Honour) that if Mr. Drummle would bring never so slight a certificate from the lady, importing that he had the honour of her acquaintance, Mr. Pip must express his regret, as a gentleman and a Finch, for &ldquo;having been betrayed into a warmth which.&rdquo; Next day was appointed for the
<pb n="319" id="p319b"/>
production (lest our honour should take cold from delay), and next day Drummle appeared with a polite little avowal in Estella's hand, that she had had the honour of dancing with him several times. This left me no course but to regret that I had been &ldquo;betrayed into a warmth which,&rdquo; and on the whole to repudiate, as untenable, the idea that I was to be found anywhere. Drummle and I then sat snorting at one another for an hour, while the Grove engaged in indiscriminate contradiction, and finally the promotion of good feeling was declared to have gone ahead at an amazing rate.</p>
<p>I tell this lightly, but it was no light thing to me. For, I cannot adequately express what pain it gave me to think that Estella should show any favour to a contemptible, clumsy, sulky booby, so very far below the average. To the present moment, I believe it to have been referable to some pure fire of generosity and disinterestedness in my love for her, that I could not endure the thought of her stooping to that hound. No doubt I should have been miserable whomsoever
<pb n="320" id="p320b"/>
she had favoured; but a worthier object would have caused me a different kind and degree of distress.</p>
<p>It was easy for me to find out, and I did soon find out, that Drummle had begun to follow her closely, and that she allowed him to do it. A little while, and he was always in pursuit of her, and he and I crossed one another every day. He held on, in a dull persistent way, and Estella held him on; now with encouragement, now with discouragement, now almost flattering him, now openly despising him, now knowing him very well, now scarcely remembering who he was.</p>
<p>The Spider, as Mr. Jaggers had called him, was used to lying in wait, however, and had the patience of his tribe. Added to that, he had a blockhead confidence in his money and in his family greatness, which sometimes did him good service&mdash;almost taking the place of concentration and determined purpose. So, the Spider, doggedly watching Estella, outwatched many brighter insects, and would often uncoil himself and drop at the right nick of time.</p>
<pb n="321" id="p321b"/>
<p>At a certain Assembly Ball at Richmond (there used to be Assembly Balls at most places then), where Estella had outshone all other beauties, this blundering Drummle so hung about her, and with so much toleration on her part, that I resolved to speak to her concerning him. I took the next opportunity: which was when she was waiting for Mrs. Brandley to take her home, and was sitting apart among some flowers, ready to go. I was with her, for I almost always accompanied them to and from such places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you tired, Estella?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather, Pip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say rather, I should not be; for I have my letter to Satis House to write, before I go to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Recounting to-night's triumph?&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Surely a very poor one, Estella.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean? I didn't know there had been any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Estella,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;do look at that fellow in the corner yonder, who is looking over here at us.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="322" id="p322b"/>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I look at him?&rdquo; returned Estella, with her eyes on me instead. &ldquo;What is there in that fellow in the corner yonder&mdash;to use your words&mdash;that I need look at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, that is the very question I want to ask you,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;For he has been hovering about you all night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moths, and all sorts of ugly creatures,&rdquo; replied Estella, with a glance towards him, &ldquo;hover about a lighted candle. Can the candle help it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I returned; &ldquo;but cannot the Estella help it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said she, laughing, after a moment, &ldquo;perhaps. Yes. Anything you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Estella, do hear me speak. It makes me wretched that you should encourage a man so generally despised as Drummle. You know he is despised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know he is as ungainly within, as without. A deficient, ill-tempered, lowering, stupid fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said she.</p>
<pb n="323" id="p323b"/>
<p>&ldquo;You know he has nothing to recommend him but money, and a ridiculous roll of addle-headed predecessors; now, don't you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said she again; and each time she said it, she opened her lovely eyes the wider.</p>
<p>To overcome the difficulty of getting past that monosyllable, I took it from her, and said, repeating it with emphasis, &ldquo;Well! Then, that is why it makes me wretched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, if I could have believed that she favoured Drummle with any idea of making me&mdash;me&mdash;wretched, I should have been in better heart about it; but in that habitual way of hers, she put me so entirely out of the question, that I could believe nothing of the kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pip,&rdquo; said Estella, casting her glance over the room, &ldquo;don't be foolish about its effect on you. It may have its effect on others, and may be meant to have. It's not worth discussing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes it is,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;because I cannot bear that people should say, &lsquo;she throws away her graces and attractions on a mere boor, the lowest in the crowd.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<pb n="324" id="p324b"/>
<p>&ldquo;I can bear it,&rdquo; said Estella.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! don't be so proud, Estella, and so inflexible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Calls me proud and inflexible in this breath!&rdquo; said Estella, opening her hands. &ldquo;And in his last breath reproached me for stooping to a boor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no doubt you do,&rdquo; said I, something hurriedly, &ldquo;for I have seen you give him looks and smiles this very night, such as you never give to&mdash;me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want me then,&rdquo; said Estella, turning suddenly with a fixed and serious, if not angry, look, &ldquo;to deceive and entrap you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you deceive and entrap him, Estella?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and many others&mdash;all of them but you. Here is Mrs. Brandley. I'll say no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now that I have given the one chapter to the theme that so filled my heart, and so often made it ache and ache again, I pass on, unhindered, to the event that had impended over me longer yet; the event that
<pb n="325" id="p325b"/>
had begun to be prepared for, before I knew that the world held Estella, and in the days when her baby intelligence was receiving its first distortions from Miss Havisham's wasting hands.</p>
<p>In the Eastern story, the heavy slab that was to fall on the bed of state in the flush of conquest was slowly wrought out of the quarry, the tunnel for the rope to hold it in its place was slowly carried through the leagues of rock, the slab was slowly raised and fitted in the roof, the rope was rove to it and slowly taken through the miles of hollow to the great iron ring. All being made ready with much labour, and the hour come, the sultan was aroused in the dead of the night, and the sharpened axe that was to sever the rope from the great iron ring was put into his hand, and he struck with it, and the rope parted and rushed away, and the ceiling fell. So, in my case; all the work, near and afar, that tended to the end, had been accomplished; and in an instant the blow was struck, and the roof of my stronghold dropped upon me.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
<p>I WAS three-and-twenty years of age. Not another word had I heard to enlighten me on the subject of my expectations, and my twenty-third birthday was a week gone. We had left Barnard's Inn more than a year, and lived in the Temple. Our chambers were in Garden-court, down by the river.</p>
<p>Mr. Pocket and I had for some time parted company as to our original relations, though we continued on the best terms. Notwithstanding my inability to settle to anything&mdash;which I hope arose out of the restless and incomplete tenure on which I held my means&mdash;I had a taste for reading, and read regularly so many hours a day. That matter of
<pb n="327" id="p327b"/>
Herbert's was still progressing, and everything with me was as I have brought it down to the close of the last chapter.</p>
<p>Business had taken Herbert on a journey to Marseilles. I was alone, and had a dull sense of being alone. Dispirited and anxious, long hoping that to-morrow or next week would clear my way, and long disappointed, I sadly missed the cheerful face and ready response of my friend.</p>
<p>It was wretched weather; stormy and wet, stormy and wet; and mud, mud, mud, deep in all the streets. Day after day, a vast heavy veil had been driving over London from the East, and it drove still, as if in the East there were an Eternity of cloud and wind. So furious had been the gusts, that high buildings in town had had the lead stripped off their roofs; and in the country, trees had been torn up, and sails of windmills carried away; and gloomy accounts had come in from the coast, of shipwreck and death. Violent blasts of rain had accompanied these rages of wind, and the day just closed as I sat down to read had been the worst of all.</p>
<p>Alterations have been made in that part
<pb n="328" id="p328b"/>
of the Temple since that time, and it has not now so lonely a character as it had then, nor is it so exposed to the river. We lived at the top of the last house, and the wind rushing up the river shook the house that night, like discharges of cannon, or breakings of a sea. When the rain came with it and dashed against the windows, I thought, raising my eyes to them as they rocked, that I might have fancied myself in a storm-beaten lighthouse. Occasionally, the smoke came rolling down the chimney as though it could not bear to go out into such a night; and when I set the doors open and looked down the staircase, the staircase lamps were blown out; and when I shaded my face with my hands and looked through the black windows (opening them ever so little, was out of the question in the teeth of such wind and rain) I saw that the lamps in the court were blown out, and that the lamps on the bridges and the shore were shuddering, and that the coal fires in barges on the river were being carried away before the wind like red-hot splashes in the rain.</p>
<p>I read with my watch upon the table, purposing
<pb n="329" id="p329b"/>
to close my book at eleven o'clock. As I shut it, Saint Paul's, and all the many church-clocks in the City&mdash;some leading, some accompanying, some following&mdash;struck that hour. The sound was curiously flawed by the wind; and I was listening, and thinking how the wind assailed and tore it, when I heard a footstep on the stair.</p>
<p>What nervous folly made me start, and awfully connect it with the footstep of my dead sister, matters not. It was past in a moment, and I listened again, and heard the footstep stumble in coming on. Remembering then, that the staircase-lights were blown out, I took up my reading-lamp and went out to the stair-head. Whoever was below had stopped on seeing my lamp, for all was quiet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is some one down there, is there not?&rdquo; I called out, looking down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said a voice from the darkness beneath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What floor do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The top. Mr. Pip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is my name.&mdash;There is nothing the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="330" id="p330b"/>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing the matter,&rdquo; returned the voice. And the man came on.</p>
<p>I stood with my lamp held out over the stair-rail, and he came slowly within its light. It was a shaded lamp, to shine upon a book, and its circle of light was very contracted; so that he was in it for a mere instant, and then out of it. In the instant, I had seen a face that was strange to me, looking up with an incomprehensible air of being touched and pleased by the sight of me.</p>
<p>Moving the lamp as the man moved, I made out that he was substantially dressed, but roughly; like a voyager by sea. That he had long iron grey hair. That his age was about sixty. That he was a muscular man, strong on his legs, and that he was browned and hardened by exposure to weather. As he ascended the last stair or two, and the light of my lamp included us both, I saw, with a stupid kind of amazement, that he was holding out both his hands to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray what is your business?&rdquo; I asked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My business?&rdquo; he repeated, pausing
<pb n="331" id="p331b"/>
&ldquo;Ah! Yes. I will explain my business, by your leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you wish to come in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;I wish to come in, Master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had asked him the question inhospitably enough, for I resented the sort of bright and gratified recognition that still shone in his face. I resented it, because it seemed to imply that he expected me to respond to it. But, I took him into the room I had just left, and, having set the lamp on the table, asked him as civilly as I could, to explain himself.</p>
<p>He looked about him with the strangest air&mdash;an air of wondering pleasure, as if he had some part in the things he admired&mdash;and he pulled off a rough outer coat, and his hat. Then, I saw that his head was furrowed and bald, and that the long iron grey hair grew only on its sides. But, I saw nothing that in the least explained him. On the contrary, I saw him next moment, once more holding out both his hands to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; said I, half suspecting him to be mad.</p>
<pb n="332" id="p332b"/>
<p>He stopped in his looking at me, and slowly rubbed his right hand over his head. &ldquo;It's disapinting to a man,&rdquo; he said, in a coarse broken voice, &ldquo;arter having looked for'ard so distant, and come so fur; but you're not to blame for that&mdash;neither on us is to blame for that. I'll speak in half a minute. Give me half a minute, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat down on a chair that stood before the fire, and covered his forehead with his large brown veinous hands. I looked at him attentively then, and recoiled a little from him; but I did not know him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There's no one nigh,&rdquo; said he, looking over his shoulder; &ldquo;is there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you, a stranger coming into my rooms at this time of the night, ask that question?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You're a game one,&rdquo; he returned, shaking his head at me with a deliberate affection, at once most unintelligible and most exasperating; &ldquo;I'm glad you've grow'd up, a game one! But don't catch hold of me. You'd be sorry arterwards to have done it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I relinquished the intention he had detected,
<pb n="333" id="p333b"/>
for I knew him! Even yet, I could not recal a single feature, but I knew him! If the wind and the rain had driven away the intervening years, had scattered all the intervening objects, had swept us to the churchyard where we first stood face to face on such different levels, I could not have known my convict more distinctly than I knew him now, as he sat in the chair before the fire. No need to take a file from his pocket and show it to me; no need to take the handkerchief from his neck and twist it round his head; no need to hug himself with both his arms, and take a shivering turn across the room, looking back at me for recognition. I knew him before he gave me one of those aids, though, a moment before, I had not been conscious of remotely suspecting his identity.</p>
<p>He came back to where I stood, and again held out both his hands. Not knowing what to do&mdash;for, in my astonishment I had lost my self-possession&mdash;I reluctantly gave him my hands. He grasped them heartily, raised them to his lips, kissed them, and still held them.</p>
<pb n="334" id="p334b"/>
<p>&ldquo;You acted noble, my boy,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Noble, Pip! And I have never forgot it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At a change in his manner as if he were even going to embrace me, I laid a hand upon his breast and put him away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay!&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Keep off! If you are grateful to me for what I did when I was a little child, I hope you have shown your gratitude by mending your way of life. If you have come here to thank me, it was not necessary. Still, however, you have found me out, there must be something good in the feeling that has brought you here, and I will not repulse you; but surely you must understand that&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>My attention was so attracted by the singularity of his fixed look at me, that the words died away on my tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You was a saying,&rdquo; he observed, when we had confronted one another in silence, &ldquo;that surely I must understand. What, surely must I understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I cannot wish to renew that chance intercourse with you of long ago, under these different circumstances. I am glad to believe you have repented and recovered yourself.
<pb n="335" id="p335b"/>
I am glad to tell you so. I am glad that, thinking I deserve to be thanked, you have come to thank me. But our ways are different ways, none the less. You are wet, and you look weary. Will you drink something before you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had replaced his neckerchief loosely, and had stood, keenly observant of me, biting a long end of it. &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he answered, still with the end at his mouth and still observant of me, &ldquo;that I <hi rend="italics">will</hi> drink (I thank you) afore I go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a tray ready on a side-table. I brought it to the table near the fire, and asked him what he would have? He touched one of the bottles without looking at it or speaking, and I made him some hot rum-and-water. I tried to keep my hand steady while I did so, but his look at me as he leaned back in his chair with the long draggled end of his neckerchief between his teeth&mdash;evidently forgotten&mdash;made my hand very difficult to master. When at last I put the glass to him, I saw with amazement that his eyes were full of tears.</p>
<p>Up to this time I had remained standing,
<pb n="336" id="p336b"/>
not to disguise that I wished him gone. But I was softened by the softened aspect of the man, and felt a touch of reproach. &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; said I, hurriedly putting something into a glass for myself, and drawing a chair to the table, &ldquo;that you will not think I spoke harshly to you just now. I had no intention of doing it, and I am sorry for it if I did. I wish you well, and happy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I put my glass to my lips, he glanced with surprise at the end of his neckerchief, dropping from his mouth when he opened it, and stretched out his hand. I gave him mine, and then he drank, and drew his sleeve across his eyes and forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you living?&rdquo; I asked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I've been a sheep-farmer, stock-breeder, other trades besides, away in the new world,&rdquo; said he: &ldquo;many a thousand mile of stormy water off from this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you have done well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I've done wonderful well. There's others went out alonger me as has done well too, but no man has done nigh as well as me. I'm famous for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to hear it.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="337" id="p337b"/>
<p>&ldquo;I hope to hear you say so, my dear boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without stopping to try to understand those words or the tone in which they were spoken, I turned off to a point that had just come into my mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever seen a messenger you once sent to me,&rdquo; I inquired, &ldquo;since he undertook that trust?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never set eyes upon him. I warn't likely to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He came faithfully, and he brought me the two one-pound notes. I was a poor boy then, as you know, and to a poor boy they were a little fortune. But, like you, I have done well since, and you must let me pay them back. You can put them to some other poor boy's use.&rdquo; I took out my purse.</p>
<p>He watched me as I laid my purse upon the table and opened it, and he watched me as I separated two one-pound notes from its contents. They were clean and new, and I spread them out and handed them over to him. Still watching me, he laid them one upon the other, folded them long-wise, gave
<pb n="338" id="p338b"/>
them a twist, set fire to them at the lamp, and dropped the ashes into the tray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I make so bold,&rdquo; he said then, with a smile that was like a frown, and with a frown that was like a smile, &ldquo;as ask you <hi rend="italics">how</hi> you have done well, since you and me was out on them lone shivering marshes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He emptied his glass, got up, and stood at the side of the fire, with his heavy brown hand on the mantelshelf. He put a foot up to the bars, to dry and warm it, and the wet boot began to steam; but, he neither looked at it, nor at the fire, but steadily looked at me. It was only now that I began to tremble.</p>
<p>When my lips had parted, and had shaped some words that were without sound, I forced myself to tell him (though I could not do it distinctly), that I had been chosen to succeed to some property.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might a mere warmint ask what property?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>I faltered, &ldquo;I don't know.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="339" id="p339b"/>
<p>&ldquo;Might a mere warmint ask whose property?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>I faltered again, &ldquo;I don't know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could I make a guess, I wonder,&rdquo; said the Convict, &ldquo;at your income since you come of age! As to the first figure now. Five?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With my heart beating like a heavy hammer of disordered action, I rose out of my chair, and stood with my hand upon the back of it, looking wildly at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Concerning a guardian,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;There ought to have been some guardian, or such-like, whiles you was a minor. Some lawyer, maybe. As to the first letter of that lawyer's name now. Would it be J?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the truth of my position came flashing on me; and its disappointments, dangers, disgraces, consequences of all kinds, rushed in in such a multitude that I was borne down by them and had to struggle for every breath I drew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put it,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;as the employer of that lawyer whose name begun with a J, and might be Jaggers&mdash;put it as he had come over sea to Portsmouth, and had
<pb n="340" id="p340b"/>
landed there, and had wanted to come on to you. &lsquo;However, you have found me out,&rsquo; you says just now. Well! However did I find you out? Why, I wrote from Portsmouth to a person in London, for particulars of your address. That person's name? Why, Wemmick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could not have spoken one word, though it had been to save my life. I stood, with a hand on the chair-back and a hand on my breast, where I seemed to be suffocating&mdash;I stood so, looking wildly at him, until I grasped at the chair, when the room began to surge and turn. He caught me, drew me to the sofa, put me up against the cushions, and bent on one knee before me: bringing the face that I now well remembered, and that I shuddered at, very near to mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Pip, dear boy, I've made a gentleman on you! It's me wot has done it! I swore that time, sure as ever I earned a guinea, that guinea should go to you. I swore arterwards, sure as ever I spec'lated and got rich, you should get rich. I lived rough, that you should live smooth; I
<pb n="341" id="p341b"/>
worked hard, that you should be above work. What odds, dear boy? Do I tell it, fur you to feel a obligation? Not a bit. I tell it, fur you to know as that there hunted dunghill dog wot you kep life in, got his head so high that he could make a gentleman&mdash;and, Pip, you're him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The abhorrence in which I held the man, the dread I had of him, the repugnance with which I shrank from him, could not have been exceeded if he had been some terrible beast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look'ee here, Pip. I'm your second father. You're my son&mdash;more to me nor any son. I've put away money, only for you to spend. When I was a hired-out shepherd in a solitary hut, not seeing no faces but faces of sheep till I half forgot wot men's and women's faces wos like, I see yourn. I drops my knife many a time in that hut when I was a eating my dinner or my supper, and I says, &lsquo;Here's the boy again, a looking at me whiles I eats and drinks!&rsquo; I see you there a many times, as plain as ever I see you on them misty marshes. &lsquo;Lord strike me dead!&rsquo; I says
<pb n="342" id="p342b"/>
each time&mdash;and I goes out in the air to say it under the open heavens&mdash;&lsquo;but wot, if I gets liberty and money, I'll make that boy a gentleman!&rsquo; And I done it. Why, look at you, dear boy! Look at these here lodgings o' yourn, fit for a lord! A lord? Ah! You shall show money with lords for wagers, and beat 'em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his heat and triumph, and in his knowledge that I had been nearly fainting, he did not remark on my reception of all this. It was the one grain of relief I had.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look'ee here!&rdquo; he went on, taking my watch out of my pocket, and turning towards him a ring on my finger, while I recoiled from his touch as if he had been a snake, &ldquo;a gold 'un and a beauty: <hi rend="italics">that's</hi> a gentleman's, I hope! A diamond all set round with rubies; <hi rend="italics">that's</hi> a gentleman's, I hope! Look at your linen; fine and beautiful! Look at your clothes; better ain't to be got! And your books too,&rdquo; turning his eyes round the room, &ldquo;mounting up, on their shelves, by hundreds! And you read 'em; don't you? I see you'd been a reading of 'em when I come in. Ha, ha,
<pb n="343" id="p343b"/>
ha! You shall read 'em to me, dear boy! And if they're in foreign languages wot I don't understand, I shall be just as proud as if I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he took both my hands and put them to his lips, while my blood ran cold within me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't you mind talking, Pip,&rdquo; said he, after again drawing his sleeve over his eyes and forehead, as the click came in his throat which I well remembered&mdash;and he was all the more horrible to me that he was so much in earnest; &ldquo;you can't do better nor keep quiet, dear boy. You ain't looked slowly forward to this as I have; you wosn't prepared for this, as I wos. But didn't you never think it might be me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O no, no, no,&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;Never never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see it <hi rend="italics">wos</hi> me, and single handed. Never a soul in it but my own self and Mr. Jaggers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was there no one else?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, with a glance of surprise: &ldquo;who else should there be? And, dear boy, how good-looking you have growed
<pb n="344" id="p344b"/>
There's bright eyes somewheres&mdash;eh? Isn't there bright eyes somewheres, wot you love the thoughts on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>O Estella, Estella!</p>
<p>&ldquo;They shall be yourn, dear boy, if money can buy 'em. Not that a gentleman like you, so well set up as you, can't win 'em off of his own game; but money shall back you! Let me finish wot I was a telling you, dear boy. From that there hut and that there hiring-out, I got money left me by my master (which died, and had been the same as me), and got my liberty and went for myself. In every single thing I went for, I went for you. &lsquo;Lord strike a blight upon it,&rsquo; I says, wotever it was I went for, &lsquo;if it ain't for him!&rsquo; It all prospered wonderful. As I giv' you to understand just now, I'm famous for it. It was the money left me, and the gains of the first few year wot I sent home to Mr. Jaggers&mdash;all for you&mdash;when he first come arter you, agreeable to my letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>O, that he had never come! That he had left me at the forge&mdash;far from contented, yet, by comparison, happy!</p>
<pb n="345" id="p345"/>
<p>&ldquo;And then, dear boy, it was a recompense to me, look'ee here, to know in secret that I was making a gentleman. The blood horses of them colonists might fling up the dust over me as I was walking; what do I say? I says to myself, &lsquo;I'm making a better gentleman nor ever <hi rend="italics">you</hi>'ll be!&rsquo; When one of 'em says to another, &lsquo;He was a convict, a few year ago, and is a ignorant common fellow now, for all he's lucky,&rsquo; what do I say?&rsquo; I says to myself, &lsquo;If I ain't a gentleman, nor yet ain't got no learning I'm the owner of such. All on you owns stock and land; which on you owns a brought-up London gentleman?&rsquo; This way I kep myself a going. And this way I held steady afore my mind that I would for certain come one day and see my boy, and make myself known to him, on his own ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laid his hand on my shoulder. shuddered at the thought that for anything I knew, his hand might be stained with blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It warn't easy, Pip, for me to leave them parts, nor yet it warn't safe. But
<pb n="346" id="p346"/>
I held to it, and the harder it was, the stronger I held, for I was determined, and my mind firm made up. At last I done it. Dear boy, I done it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I tried to collect my thoughts, but I was stunned. Throughout, I had seemed to myself to attend more to the wind and the rain than to him; even now, I could not separate his voice from those voices, though those were loud and his was silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where will you put me?&rdquo; he asked, presently. &ldquo;I must be put somewheres, dear boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To sleep?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And to sleep long and sound,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;for I've been sea-tossed and sea-washed, months and months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend and companion,&rdquo; said I, rising from the sofa, &ldquo;is absent; you must have his room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won't come back to-morrow; will he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, answering almost mechanically, in spite of my utmost efforts; &ldquo;not to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, look'ee here, dear boy,&rdquo; he said,
<pb n="347" id="p347"/>
dropping his voice, and laying a long finger on my breast in an impressive manner, &ldquo;caution is necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you mean? Caution?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By G&mdash;, it's Death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What's death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was sent for life. It's death to come back. There's been overmuch coming back of late years, and I should of a certainty be hanged if took.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing was needed but this; the wretched man, after loading wretched me with his gold and silver chains for years, had risked his life to come to me, and I held it there in my keeping! If I had loved him instead of abhorring him; if I had been attracted to him by the strongest admiration and affection, instead of shrinking from him with the strongest repugnance; it could have been no worse. On the contrary, it would have been better, for his preservation would then have naturally and tenderly addressed my heart.</p>
<p>My first care was to close the shutters, so that no light might be seen from without, and then to close and make fast the doors
<pb n="348" id="p348"/>
While I did so, he stood at the table drinking rum and eating biscuit; and when I saw him thus engaged, I saw my convict on the marshes at his meal again. It almost seemed to me as if he must stoop down presently, to file at his leg.</p>
<p>When I had gone into Herbert's room, and had shut off any other communication between it and the staircase than through the room in which our conversation had been held, I asked him if he would go to bed? He said yes, but asked me for some of my &ldquo;gentleman's linen&rdquo; to put on in the morning. I brought it out, and laid it ready for him, and my blood again ran cold when he again took me by both hands to give me good night.</p>
<p>I got away from him, without knowing how I did it, and mended the fire in the room where we had been together, and sat down by it, afraid to go to bed. For an hour or more, I remained too stunned to think; and it was not until I began to think, that I began fully to know how wrecked I was, and how the ship in which I had sailed was gone to pieces.</p>
<pb n="349" id="p349"/>
<p>Miss Havisham's intentions towards me, all a mere dream; Estella not designed for me; I only suffered in Satis House as a convenience, a sting for the greedy relations, a model with a mechanical heart to practise on when no other practice was at hand; those were the first smarts I had. But, sharpest and deepest pain of all&mdash;it was for the convict, guilty of I knew not what crimes, and liable to be taken out of those rooms where I sat thinking, and hanged at the Old Bailey door, that I had deserted Joe.</p>
<p>I would not have gone back to Joe now, I would not have gone back to Biddy now, for any consideration: simply, I suppose, because my sense of my own worthless conduct to them was greater than every consideration. No wisdom on earth could have given me the comfort that I should have derived from their simplicity and fidelity; but I could never, never, never, undo what I had done.</p>
<p>In every rage of wind and rush of rain, I heard pursuers. Twice, I could have sworn there was a knocking and whispering at the outer door. With these fears upon me, I
<pb n="350" id="p350"/>
began either to imagine or recal that I had had mysterious warnings of this man's approach. That, for weeks gone by, I had passed faces in the streets which I had thought like his. That, these likenesses had grown more numerous, as he, coming over the sea, had drawn nearer. That, his wicked spirit had somehow sent these messengers to mine, and that now on this stormy night he was as good as his word, and with me.</p>
<p>Crowding up with these reflections came the reflection that I had seen him with my childish eyes to be a desperately violent man; that I had heard that other convict reiterate that he had tried to murder him; that I had seen him down in the ditch tearing and fighting like a wild beast. Out of such remembrances I brought into the light of the fire, a half-formed terror that it might not be safe to be shut up there with him in the dead of the wild solitary night. This dilated until it filled the room, and impelled me to take a candle and go in and look at my dreadful burden.</p>
<p>He had rolled a handkerchief round his head, and his face was set and lowering in
<pb n="351" id="p351"/>
his sleep. But he was asleep, and quietly too, though he had a pistol lying on the pillow. Assured of this, I softly removed the key to the outside of his door, and turned it on him before I again sat down by the fire. Gradually I slipped from the chair and lay on the floor. When I awoke, without having parted in my sleep with the perception of my wretchedness, the clocks of the Eastward churches were striking five, the candles were wasted out, the fire was dead, and the wind and rain intensified the thick black darkness.</p>
