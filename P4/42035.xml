<head>THE WAR <lb/> WITH THE SARDINIANS</head>
<p>Has evidently thrown no check over the inventive faculties of the French. Although <foreign
lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">la gloire</hi></foreign> is the theme of conversation amongst the <foreign
lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">habitu&eacute;s</hi></foreign> of <foreign><hi
rend="italics">le club,</hi></foreign> the prattle of the <foreign lang="fre"><hi
rend="italics">beau monde</hi></foreign> is still, as ever, What dress? what bonnet? and what mode?</p>
<p>Indeed we learn from amusing and instructing letters from the Parisian agents of the Messrs. JAY that the only effect of a declaration of war amongst <foreign><hi
rend="italics">les belles,</hi></foreign> is, that &ldquo;white bonnets appear to bristle like a phalanx of bayonets more than ever in the Bois de Boulogne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is likewise curious to observe in these communications the practical despotism which occasionally oozes out even in a matter so apparently insignificant as Fashion. &ldquo;Your season <hi
rend="italics">shall</hi> not commence until June,&rdquo; says one: &ldquo;Send your Modiste over at once,&rdquo; says another; and although this house had not intended to have done this until some fortnight hence, such is the submission to the behests of the imperial rulers of &ldquo;shape and make,&rdquo; that the telegraph is on the instant put into requisition to announce that the Head Milliner of the Firm is <hi
rend="italics">en route</hi> for the city of Fashion, to return again to our shores, it may be, but a few hours after this appears in type.</p>

<head>IN THREE BOOKS.</head>
<div2>
<head>BOOK THE FIRST. RECALLED TO LIFE.</head>
<div3>
<head>CHAPTER I. <lb/> THE PERIOD.</head>
<p>IT was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way&mdash;in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.</p>
<p>There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes, that things in general were settled for ever.</p>
<p>It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five. Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period, as at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were made for the swallowing up of London and Westminster. Even the Cock-lane ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out its messages, as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally deficient in originality) rapped out theirs. Mere messages in the earthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People, from a congress of British subjects in America: which, strange to relate, have proved more important to the human race than any communications yet received through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane brood.</p>
<p>France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her sister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness
<pb id="p2a" n="2"/>
down hill, making paper money and spending it. Under the guidance of her Christian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue torn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks which passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty yards. It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France and Norway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death, already marked by the woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into boards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in it, terrible in history. It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were sheltered from the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with rustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which the Farmer, Death, had already set apart to be his tumbrils of the Revolution. But, that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work unceasingly, work silently, and no one heard them as they went about with muffled tread: the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion that they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous.</p>
<p>In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to justify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and highway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night; families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing their furniture to upholsterers' warehouses for security; the highwayman in the dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and challenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of &ldquo;the Captain,&rdquo; gallantly shot him through the head and rode away; the mail was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and then got shot dead himself by the other four, &ldquo;in consequence of the failure of his ammunition:&rdquo; after which the mail was robbed in peace; that magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand and deliver on Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who despoiled the illustrious creature in sight of all his retinue; prisoners in London gaols fought battles with their turnkeys, and the majesty of the law fired blunderbusses in among them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball; thieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at Court drawing-rooms; musketeers went into St. Giles's, to search for contraband goods, and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the musketeers fired on the mob; and nobody thought any of these occurrences much out of the common way. In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy and ever worse than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing up long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker on Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in the hand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the door of Westminster Hall; to-day, taking the life of an atrocious murderer, and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer's boy of sixpence.</p>
<p>All these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and close upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five. Environed by them, while the Woodman and the Farmer worked unheeded, those two of the large jaws, and those
<pb id="p3a" n="3"/>
other two of the plain and the fair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their divine rights with a high hand. Thus did the year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five conduct their Greatnesses, and myriads of small creatures&mdash;the creatures of this chronicle among the rest&mdash;along the roads that lay before them.</p>
</div3><div3>
<head>CHAPTER II. <lb/> THE MAIL.</head>
<p>IT was the Dover road that lay, on a Friday night late in November, before the first of the persons with whom this history has business. The Dover road lay, as to him, beyond the Dover mail, as it lumbered up Shooter's Hill. He walked up-hill in the mire by the side of the mail, as the rest of the passengers did; not because they had the least relish for walking exercise, under the circumstances, but because the hill, and the harness, and the mud, and the mail, were all so heavy, that the horses had three times already come to a stop, besides once drawing the coach across the road, with the mutinous intent of taking it back to Blackheath. Reins and whip and coachman and guard, however, in combination, had read that article of war which forbad a purpose otherwise strongly in favour of the argument, that some brute animals are endued with Reason; and the team had capitulated and returned to their duty.</p>
<p>With drooping heads and tremulous tails, they mashed their way through the thick mud, floundering and stumbling between whiles as if they were falling to pieces at the larger joints. As often as the driver rested them and brought them to a stand, with a wary &ldquo;Wo-ho! so-ho then!&rdquo; the near leader violently shook his head and everything upon it&mdash;like an unusually emphatic horse, denying that the coach could be got up the hill. Whenever the leader made this rattle, the passenger started, as a nervous passenger might, and was disturbed in mind.</p>
<p>There was a steaming mist in all the hollows, and it had roamed in its forlornness up the hill, like an evil spirit, seeking rest and finding none. A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way through the air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another, as the waves of an unwholesome sea might do. It was dense enough to shut out everything from the light of the coachlamps but these its own workings, and a few yards of road; and the reek of the labouring horses steamed into it, as if they had made it all.</p>
<p>Two other passengers, besides the one, were plodding up the hill by the side of the mail. All three were wrapped to the cheek-bones and over the ears, and wore jack-boots. Not one of the three could have said, from anything he saw, what either of the other two was like; and each was hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind, as from the eyes of the body, of his two companions.
<pb id="p4a" n="4"/>
In those days, travellers were very shy of being confidential on a short notice, for anybody on the road might be a robber or in league with robbers. As to the latter, when every posting-house and ale-house could produce somebody in &ldquo;the Captain's&rdquo; pay, ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable non-descript, it was the likeliest thing upon the cards. So the guard of the Dover mail thought to himself, that Friday night in November one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, lumbering up Shooter's Hill, as he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail, beating his feet, and keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-chest before him, where a loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols, deposited on a substratum of cutlass.</p>
<p>The Dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected the passengers, the passengers suspected one another and the guard, they all suspected everybody else, and the coachman was sure of nothing but the horses; as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience have taken his oath on the two Testaments that they were not fit for the journey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wo-ho!&rdquo; said the coachman. &ldquo;So, then! One more pull and you're at the top and be damned to you, for I have had trouble enough to get you to it!&mdash;Joe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halloa!&rdquo; the guard replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What o'clock do you make it, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten minutes, good, past eleven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My blood!&rdquo; ejaculated the vexed coachman, &ldquo;and not atop of Shooter's yet! Tst! Yah! Get on with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The emphatic horse, cut short by the whip in a most decided negative, made a decided scramble for it, and the three other horses followed suit. Once more, the Dover mail struggled on, with the jack-boots of its passengers squashing along by its side. They had stopped when the coach stopped, and they kept close company with it. If any one of the three had had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead into the mist and darkness, he would have put himself in a fair way of getting shot instantly as a highwayman.</p>
<p>The last burst carried the mail to the summit of the hill. The horses stopped to breathe again, and the guard got down to skid the wheel for the descent, and open the coach door to let the passengers in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tst! Joe!&rdquo; cried the coachman in a warning voice, looking down from his box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They both listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say a horse at a canter coming up, Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italics">I</hi> say a horse at a gallop, Tom,&rdquo; returned the guard, leaving his hold of the door, and mounting nimbly to his place. &ldquo;Gentlemen! In the king's name, all of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this hurried adjuration, he cocked his blunderbuss, and stood on the offensive.</p>
<p>The passenger booked by this history, was on the coach step, getting in; the two other passengers were close behind him, and about to follow. He remained on the step, half in the coach and half out of it; they remained in the road below him. They all looked
<pb n="5" id="p5a"/>
from the coachman to the guard, and from the guard to the coachman, and listened. The coachman looked back, and the guard looked back, and even the emphatic leader pricked up his ears and looked back, without contradicting.</p>
<p>The stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring of the coach, added to the stillness of the night, made it very quiet indeed. The panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion to the coach, as if it were in a state of agitation. The hearts of the passengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard; but at any rate, the quiet pause was audibly expressive of people out of breath, and holding the breath, and having the pulses quickened by expectation.</p>
<p>The sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So-ho!&rdquo; the guard sang out, as loud as he could roar. &ldquo;Yo there! Stand! I shall fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pace was suddenly checked, and, with much splashing and floundering, a man's voice called from the mist, &ldquo;Is that the Dover mail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never you mind what it is?&rdquo; the guard retorted. &ldquo;What are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italics">Is</hi> that the Dover mail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you want to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want a passenger, if it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What passenger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Jarvis Lorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our booked passenger showed in a moment that it was his name. The guard, the coachman, and the two other passengers, eyed him distrustfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep where you are,&rdquo; the guard called to the voice in the mist, &ldquo;because, if I should make a mistake, it could never be set right in your lifetime. Gentleman of the name of Lorry answer straight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; asked the passenger, then, with mildly quavering speech. &ldquo;Who wants me? Is it Jerry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>(&ldquo;I don't like Jerry's voice, if it is Jerry,&rdquo; growled the guard to himself. &ldquo;He's hoarser than suits me, is Jerry.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Lorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A despatch sent after you from over yonder. T. and Co.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know this messenger, guard,&rdquo; said Mr. Lorry, getting down into the road&mdash;assisted from behind more swiftly than politely by the other two passengers, who immediately scrambled into the coach, shut the door, and pulled up the window. &ldquo;He may come close; there's nothing wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope there ain't, but I can't make so 'Nation sure of that,&rdquo; said the guard, in gruff soliloquy. &ldquo;Hallo you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! And hallo you!&rdquo; said Jerry, more hoarsely than before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on at a footpace; d'ye mind me? And if you've got holsters to that saddle o' yourn, don't let me see your hand go nigh 'em. For I'm a devil at a quick mistake, and when I make one it takes the form of Lead. So now let's look at you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The figures of a horse and rider came slowly through the eddying mist, and came to the side of the mail, where the passenger stood.
<pb n="6" id="p6a"/>
The rider stooped, and, casting up his eyes at the guard, handed the passenger a small folded paper. The rider's horse was blown, and both horse and rider were covered with mud, from the hoofs of the horse to the hat of the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guard!&rdquo; said the passenger, in a tone of quiet business confidence.</p>
<p>The watchful guard, with his right hand at the stock of his raised blunderbuss, his left at the barrel, and his eye on the horseman, answered curtly, &ldquo;Sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing to apprehend. I belong to Tellson's Bank. You must know Tellson's Bank in London. I am going to Paris on business. A crown to drink. I may read this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If so be as you're quick, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He opened it in the light of the coach-lamp on that side, and read&mdash;first to himself and then aloud: &ldquo; &lsquo;Wait at Dover for Mam'selle.&rsquo; It's not long, you see, guard. Jerry, say that my answer was, RECALLED TO LIFE.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry started in his saddle. &ldquo;That's a Blazing strange answer, too,&rdquo; said he, at his hoarsest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take that message back, and they will know that I received this, as well as if I wrote. Make the best of your way. Good night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With those words the passenger opened the coach-door and got in; not at all assisted by his fellow-passengers, who had expeditiously secreted their watches and purses in their boots, and were now making a general pretence of being asleep. With no more definite purpose than to escape the hazard of originating any other kind of action.</p>
<p>The coach lumbered on again, with heavier wreaths of mist closing round it as it began the descent. The guard soon replaced his blunderbuss in his arm-chest, and, having looked to the rest of its contents, and having looked to the supplementary pistols that he wore in his belt, looked to a smaller chest beneath his seat, in which there were a few smith's tools, a couple of torches, and a tinder-box. For he was furnished with that completeness, that if the coach-lamps had been blown and stormed out, which did occasionally happen, he had only to shut himself up inside, keep the flint and steel sparks well off the straw, and get a light with tolerable safety and ease (if he were lucky) in five minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom!&rdquo; softly over the coach-roof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo, Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear the message?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did, Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you make of it, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all, Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's a coin<hi rend="italics">ci</hi>dence, too,&rdquo; the guard mused, &ldquo;for I made the same of it myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry, left alone in the mist and darkness, dismounted meanwhile, not only to ease his spent horse, but to wipe the mud from his face, and shake the wet out of his hat-brim, which might be capable of holding about half a gallon. After standing with the bridle over his heavily-splashed arm, until the wheels of the mail were no longer within hearing and the night was quite still again, he turned to walk down the hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After that there gallop from Temple-bar, old lady, I won't trust
<pb n="7" id="p7a"/>
your fore-legs till I get you on the level,&rdquo; said this hoarse messenger, glancing at his mare. &ldquo; &lsquo;Recalled to life.&rsquo; That's a Blazing strange message. Much of that wouldn't do for you, Jerry! I say, Jerry! You'd be in a Blazing bad way, if recalling to life was to come into fashion, Jerry!&rdquo;</p>

<head>CHAPTER III. <lb/> THE NIGHT SHADOWS.</head>
<p>A WONDERFUL fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other. A solemn consideration, when I enter a great city by night, that every one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that every room in every one of them encloses its own secret; that every beating heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there, is, in some of its imaginings, a secret to the heart nearest it! Something of the awfulness, even of Death itself, is referable to this. No more can I turn the leaves of this dear book that I loved, and vainly hope in time to read it all. No more can I look into the depths of this unfathomable water, wherein, as momentary lights glanced into it, I have had glimpses of buried treasure and other things submerged. It was appointed that the book should shut with a spring, for ever and for ever, when I had read but a page. It was appointed that the water should be locked in an eternal frost, when the light was playing on its surface, and I stood in ignorance on the shore. My friend is dead, my neighbour is dead, my love, the darling of my soul, is dead; it is the inexorable consolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was always in that individuality, and which I shall carry in mine to my life's end. In any of the burial-places of this city through which I pass, is there a sleeper more inscrutable than its busy inhabitants are, in their innermost personality, to me, or than I am to them?</p>
<p>As to this, his natural and not to be alienated inheritance, the messenger on horseback had exactly the same possessions as the King, the first Minister of State, or the richest merchant in London. So with the three passengers shut up in the narrow compass of one lumbering old mail coach; they were mysteries to one another, as complete as if each had been in his own coach and six, or his own coach and sixty, with the breadth of a county between him and the next.</p>
<p>The messenger rode back at an easy trot, stopping pretty often at ale-houses by the way to drink, but evincing a tendency to keep his own counsel, and to keep his hat cocked over his eyes. He had eyes that assorted very well with that decoration, being of a surface black, with no depth in the colour or form, and much too near together&mdash;as if they were afraid of being found out in something, singly, if they kept too far apart. They had a sinister expression, under an old cocked-hat like a three-cornered spittoon, and over a great muffler for he chin and throat, which descended nearly to the wearer's knees.
<pb n="8" id="p8a"/>
When he stopped for drink, he moved this muffler with his left hand, only while he poured his liquor in with his right; as soon as that was done, he muffled again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Jerry, no!&rdquo; said the messenger, harping on one theme as he rode. &ldquo;It wouldn't do for you, Jerry. Jerry, you honest tradesman, it wouldn't suit <hi
rend="italics">your</hi> line of business! Recalled&mdash;! Bust me if I don't think he'd been a drinking!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His message perplexed his mind to that degree that he was fain, several times, to take off his hat to scratch his head. Except on the crown, which was raggedly bald, he had stiff, black hair, standing jaggedly all over it, and growing down-hill almost to his broad, blunt nose. It was so like smith's work, so much more like the top of a strongly spiked wall than a head of hair, that the best of players at leap-frog might have declined him, as the most dangerous man in the world to go over.</p>
<p>While he trotted back with the message he was to deliver to the night watchman in his box at the door of Tellson's Bank, by Templebar, who was to deliver it to greater authorities within, the shadows of the night took such shapes to him as arose out of the message, and took such shapes to the mare as arose out of <hi
rend="italics">her</hi> private topics of uneasiness. They seemed to be numerous, for she shied at every shadow on the road.</p>
<p>What time, the mail-coach lumbered, jolted, rattled, and bumped upon its tedious way, with its three fellow inscrutables inside. To whom, likewise, the shadows of the night revealed themselves, in the forms their dozing eyes and wandering thoughts suggested.</p>
<p>Tellson's Bank had a run upon it in the mail. As the bank passenger&mdash;with an arm drawn through the leathern strap, which did what lay in it to keep him from pounding against the next passenger, and driving him into his corner, whenever the coach got a special jolt&mdash;nodded in his place with half-shut eyes, the little coach-windows, and the coach-lamp dimly gleaming through them, and the bulky bundle of opposite passenger, became the bank, and did a great stroke of business. The rattle of the harness was the chink of money, and more drafts were honoured in five minutes than even Tellson's, with all its foreign and home connexion, ever paid in thrice the time. Then, the strong-rooms underground, at Tellson's, with such of their valuable stores and secrets as were known to the passenger (and it was not a little that he knew about them), opened before him, and he went in among them with the great keys and the feebly-burning candle, and found them safe, and strong, and sound, and still, just as he had last seen them.</p>
<p>But, though the bank was almost always with him, and though the coach (in a confused way, like the presence of pain under an opiate) was always with him, there was another current of impression that never ceased to run, all through the night. He was on his way to dig some one out of a grave.</p>
<p>Now, which of the multitude of faces that showed themselves before him was the true face of the buried person, the shadows of the night did not indicate; but they were all the faces of a man of five-and-forty by years, and they differed principally in the passions they expressed, and in the ghastliness of their worn and wasted state. Pride, contempt, defiance, stubbornness, submission, lamentation,
<pb n="9" id="p9"/>
succeeded one another; so did varieties of sunken cheek, cadaverous colour, emaciated hands and figures. But the face was in the main one face, and every head was prematurely white. A hundred times the dozing passenger inquired of this spectre:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buried how long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer was always the same: &ldquo;Almost eighteen years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had abandoned all hope of being dug out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know that you are recalled to life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They tell me so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you care to live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can't say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I show her to you? Will you come and see her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answers to this question were various and contradictory. Sometimes the broken reply was, &ldquo;Wait! It would kill me if I saw her too soon.&rdquo; Sometimes, it was given in a tender rain of tears, and then it was, &ldquo;Take me to her.&rdquo; Sometimes, it was staring and bewildered, and then it was, &ldquo;I don't know her. I don't understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After such imaginary discourse, the passenger in his fancy would dig, and dig, dig&mdash;now, with a spade, now with a great key, now with his hands&mdash;to dig this wretched creature out. Got out at last, with earth hanging about his face and hair, he would suddenly fall away to dust. The passenger would then start to himself, and lower the window, to get the reality of mist and rain on his cheek.</p>
<p>Yet even when his eyes were opened on the mist and rain, on the moving patch of light from the lamps, and the hedge at the roadside retreating by jerks, the night shadows outside the coach would fall into the train of the night shadows within. The real Banking-house by Temple-bar, the real business of the past day, the real strong-rooms, the real express sent after him, and the real message returned, would all be there. Out of the midst of them, the ghostly face would rise, and he would accost it again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buried how long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost eighteen years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you care to live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can't say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dig&mdash;dig&mdash;dig&mdash;until an impatient movement from one of the two passengers would admonish him to pull up the window, draw his arm securely through the leathern strap, and speculate upon the two slumbering forms, until his mind lost its hold of them, and they again slid away into the bank and the grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buried how long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost eighteen years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had abandoned all hope of being dug out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words were still in his hearing as just spoken&mdash;distinctly in his hearing as ever spoken words had been in his life&mdash;when the weary passenger started to the consciousness of daylight, and found that the shadows of the night were gone.</p>
<p>He lowered the window, and looked out at the rising sun. There was a ridge of ploughed land, with a plough upon it where it had been left last night when the horses were unyoked; beyond, a quiet coppice-wood, in which many leaves of burning red and golden yellow
<pb n="10" id="p10"/>
still remained upon the trees. Though the earth was cold and wet, the sky was clear, and the sun rose bright, placid, and beautiful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eighteen years!&rdquo; said the passenger, looking at the sun. &ldquo;Gracious Creator of Day! To be buried alive for eighteen years!&rdquo;</p>
</div3><div3>
<head>CHAPTER IV. <lb/> THE PREPARATION.</head>
<p>WHEN the mail got successfully to Dover, in the course of the forenoon, the head-drawer at the Royal George Hotel opened the coach-door, as his custom was. He did it with some flourish of ceremony, for a mail journey from London in winter was an achievement to congratulate an adventurous traveller upon.</p>
<p>By that time, there was only one adventurous traveller left to be congratulated; for the two others had been set down at their respective roadside destinations. The mildewy inside of the coach, with its damp and dirty straw, its disagreeable smell, and its obscurity, was rather like a larger sort of dog-kennel. Mr. Lorry, the passenger, shaking himself out of it, in chains of straw, a tangle of shaggy wrapper, flapping hat, and muddy legs, was rather like a larger sort of dog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be a packet to Calais to-morrow, drawer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, if the weather holds and the wind sets tolerable fair. The tide will serve pretty nicely at about two in the afternoon, sir. Bed, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not go to bed till night; but I want a bedroom, and a barber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then breakfast, sir? Yes, sir. That way, sir, if you please. Show Concord! Gentleman's valise and hot water to Concord. Pull off gentleman's boots in Concord. (You will find a fine sea-coal fire, sir.) Fetch barber to Concord. Stir about there, now, for Concord!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Concord bed-chamber being always assigned to a passenger by the mail, and passengers by the mail being always heavily wrapped up from head to foot, the room had the odd interest for the establishment of the Royal George, that although but one kind of man was seen to go into it, all kinds and varieties of men came out of it. Consequently, another drawer, and two porters, and several maids, and the landlady, were all loitering by accident at various points of the road between the Concord and the coffee-room, when a gentleman of sixty, formally dressed in a brown suit of clothes, pretty well worn, but very well kept, with large square cuffs and large flaps to the pockets, passed along on his way to his breakfast.</p>
<p>The coffee-room had no other occupant, that forenoon, than the gentleman in brown. His breakfast-table was drawn before the fire, and as he sat, with its light shining on him, waiting for the meal, he sat so still, that he might have been sitting for his portrait.</p>
<p>Very orderly and methodical he looked, with a hand on each knee,
<pb n="11" id="p11"/>
and a loud watch ticking a sonorous sermon under his flapped waistcoat, as though it pitted its gravity and longevity against the levity and evanescence of the brisk fire. He had a good leg, and was a little vain of it, for his brown stockings fitted sleek and close, and were of a fine texture; his shoes and buckles, too, though plain, were trim. He wore an odd little sleek crisp flaxen wig, setting very close to his head: which wig, it is to be presumed, was made of hair, but which looked far more as though it were spun from filaments of silk or glass. His linen, though not of a fineness in accordance with his stockings, was as white as the tops of the waves that broke upon the neighbouring beach, or the specks of sale that glinted in the sunlight far at sea. A face, habitually suppressed and quieted, was still lighted up under the quaint wig by a pair of moist bright eyes that it must have cost their owner, in years gone by, some pains to drill to the composed and reserved expression of Tellson's Bank. He had a healthy colour in his cheeks, and his face, though lined, bore few traces of anxiety. But, perhaps the confidential bachelor clerks in Tellson's Bank were principally occupied with the cares of other people; and perhaps second-hand cares, like second-hand clothes, come easily off and on.</p>
<p>Completing his resemblance to a man who was sitting for his portrait, Mr. Lorry dropped off asleep. The arrival of his breakfast roused him, and he said to the drawer, as he moved his chair to it:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish accommodation prepared for a young lady who may come here at any time to-day. She may ask for Mr. Jarvis Lorry, or she may only ask for a gentleman from Tellson's Bank. Please to let me know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. Tellson's Bank in London, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. We have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentlemen in their travelling backwards and forwards betwixt London and Paris, sir. A vast deal of travelling, sir, in Tellson and Company's House.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. We are quite a French house, as well as an English one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. Not much in the habit of such travelling yourself, I think, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not of late years. It is fifteen years since we&mdash;since I&mdash;came last from France.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, sir? That was before my time here, sir. Before our people's time here, sir. The George was in other hands at that time, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I would hold a pretty wager, sir, that a House like Tellson and Company was flourishing, a matter of fifty, not to speak of fifteen years ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might treble that, and say a hundred and fifty, yet not be far from the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rounding his mouth and both his eyes, as he stepped backward from the table, the waiter shifted his napkin from his right arm to his left, dropped into a comfortable attitude, and stood surveying the guest while he ate and drank, as from an observatory or watch-tower. According to the immemorial usage of waiters in all ages.</p>
<pb id="p12" n="12"/>
<p>When Mr. Lorry had finished his breakfast, he went out for a stroll on the beach. The little narrow, crooked town of Dover hid itself away from the beach, and ran its head into the chalk cliffs, like a marine ostrich. The beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stones tumbling wildly about, and the sea did what it liked, and what it liked was destruction. It thundered at the town, and thundered at the cliffs, and brought the coast down, madly. The air among the houses was of so strong a piscatory flavour that one might have supposed sick fish went up to be dipped in it, as sick people went down to be dipped in the sea. A little fishing was done in the port, and a quantity of strolling about by night, and looking seaward: particularly at those times when the tide made, and was near flood. Small tradesmen, who did no business whatever, sometimes unaccountably realised large fortunes, and it was remarkable that nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter.</p>
<p>As the day declined into the afternoon, and the air, which had been at intervals clear enough to allow the French coast to be seen, became again charged with mist and vapour, Mr. Lorry's thoughts seemed to cloud too. When it was dark, and he sat before the coffee-room fire, awaiting his dinner as he had awaited his breakfast, his mind was busily digging, digging, digging, in the live red coals.</p>
<p>A bottle of good claret after dinner does a digger in the red coals no harm, otherwise than as it has a tendency to throw him out of work. Mr. Lorry had been idle a long time, and had just poured out his last glassful of wine with as complete an appearance of satisfaction as is ever to be found in an elderly gentleman of a fresh complexion who has got to the end of a bottle, when a rattling of wheels came up the narrow street, and rumbled into the inn-yard.</p>
<p>He set down his glass untouched. &ldquo;This is Mam'selle!&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>In a very few minutes the waiter came in, to announce that Miss Manette had arrived from London, and would be happy to see the gentleman from Tellson's.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Manette had taken some refreshment on the road, and required none then, and was extremely anxious to see the gentleman from Tellson's immediately, if it suited his pleasure and convenience.</p>
<p>The gentleman from Tellson's had nothing left for it but to empty his glass with an air of stolid desperation, settle his odd little flaxen wig at the ears, and follow the waiter to Miss Manette's apartment. It was a large, dark room, furnished in a funereal manner with black horsehair, and loaded with heavy dark tables. These had been oiled and oiled, until the two tall candles on the table in the middle of the room were gloomily reflected on every leaf; as if <hi
rend="italics">they</hi> were buried, in deep graves of black mahogany, and no light to speak of could be expected from them until they were dug out.</p>
<p>The obscurity was so difficult to penetrate that Mr. Lorry, picking his way over the well-worn Turkey carpet, supposed Miss Manette to be, for the moment, in some adjacent room, until, having got past the two tall candles, he saw standing to receive him by the table between them and the fire, a young lady of not more than seventeen, in a riding-cloak, and still holding her straw travelling-hat by its ribbon, in her hand. As his eyes rested on a short, slight, pretty
<pb n="13" id="p13"/>
figure, a quantity of golden hair, a pair of blue eyes that met his own with an inquiring look, and a forehead with a singular capacity (remembering how young and smooth it was), of lifting and knitting itself into an expression that was not quite one of perplexity, or wonder, or alarm, or merely of a bright fixed attention, though it included all the four expressions&mdash;as his eyes rested on these things, a sudden vivid likeness passed before him, of a child whom he had held in his arms on the passage across that very Channel, one cold time, when the hail drifted heavily and the sea ran high. The likeness passed away, say, like a breath along the surface of the gaunt pier-glass behind her, on the frame of which, a hospital procession of negro cupids, several headless and all cripples, were offering black baskets of Dead Sea fruit to black divinities of the feminine gender&mdash;and he made his formal bow to Miss Manette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray take a seat, sir.&rdquo; In a very clear and pleasant young voice: a little foreign in its accent, but a very little indeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I kiss your hand, miss,&rdquo; said Mr. Lorry, with the manners of an earlier date, as he made his formal bow again, and took his seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I received a letter from the Bank, sir, yesterday, informing me that some new intelligence&mdash;or discovery&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The word is not material, miss; either word will do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;respecting the small property of my poor father whom I never saw&mdash;so long dead&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Lorry moved in his chair, and cast a troubled look towards the hospital procession of negro cupids. As if <hi
rend="italics">they</hi> had any help for anybody in their absurd baskets!</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;rendered it necessary that I should go to Paris, there to communicate with a gentleman of the Bank, so good as to be despatched to Paris for the purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I was prepared to hear, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She curtseyed to him (young ladies made curtseys in those days), with a pretty desire to convey to him that she felt how much older and wiser he was than she. He made her another bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I replied to the Bank, sir, that as it was considered necessary, by those who know, and who are so kind as to advise me, that I should go to France, and that as I am an orphan and have no friend who could go with me, I should esteem it highly if I might be permitted to place myself, during the journey, under that worthy gentleman's protection. The gentleman had left London, but I think a messenger was sent after him to beg the favour of his waiting for me here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was happy,&rdquo; said Mr. Lorry, &ldquo;to be entrusted with the charge. I shall be more happy to execute it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I thank you indeed. I thank you very gratefully. It was told me by the Bank that the gentleman would explain to me the details of the business, and that I must prepare myself to find them of a surprising nature. I have done my best to prepare myself, and I naturally have a strong and eager interest to know what they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; said Mr. Lorry. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a pause, he added, again settling the crisp flaxen wig at the ears:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very difficult to begin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not begin, but, in his indecision, met her glance. The
<pb n="14" id="p14"/>
young forehead lifted itself into that singular expression&mdash;but it was pretty and characteristic, besides being singular&mdash;and she raised her hand, as if with an involuntary action she caught at, or stayed, some passing shadow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you quite a stranger to me, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I not?&rdquo; Mr. Lorry opened his hands, and extended them outward with an argumentative smile.</p>
<p>Between the eyebrows and just over the little feminine nose, the line of which was as delicate and fine as it was possible to be, the expression deepended itself as she took her seat thoughtfully in the chair by which she had hitherto remained standing. He watched her as she mused, and the moment she raised her eyes again, went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In your adopted country, I presume, I cannot do better than address you as a young English lady, Miss Manette?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Manette, I am a man of business. I have a business charge to acquit myself of. In your reception of it, don't heed me any more than if I was a speaking machine&mdash;truly, I am not much else. I will, with your leave, relate to you, miss, the story of one of our customers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Story!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seemed wilfully to mistake the word she had repeated, when he added, in a hurry, &ldquo;Yes, customers; in the banking business we usually call our connexion our customers. He was a French gentleman; a scientific gentleman; a man of great acquirements&mdash;a Doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not of Beauvais?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, of Beauvais. Like Monsieur Manette, your father, the gentleman was of Beauvais. Like Monsieur Manette, your father, the gentleman was of repute in Paris. I had the honour of knowing him there. Our relations were business relations, but confidential. I was at that time in our French House, and had been&mdash;oh! twenty years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At that time&mdash;I may ask, at what time, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I speak, miss, of twenty years ago. He married&mdash;an English lady&mdash;and I was one of the trustees. His affairs, like the affairs of many other French gentlemen and French families, were entirely in Tellson's hands. In a similar way, I am, or I have been, trustee of one kind or other for scores of our customers. These are mere business relations, miss; there is no friendship in them, no particular interest, nothing like sentiment. I have passed from one to another, in the course of my business life, just as I pass from one of our customers to another in the course of my business day; in short, I have no feelings; I am a mere machine. To go on&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this is my father's story, sir; and I begin to think&rdquo;&mdash;the curiously roughened forehead was very intent upon him&mdash;&ldquo;that when I was left an orphan, through my mother's surviving my father only two years, it was you who brought me to England. I am almost sure it was you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Lorry took the hesitating little hand that confidingly advanced to take his, and he put it with some ceremony to his lips. He then conducted the young lady straightway to her chair again, and, holding the chair-back with his left hand, and using his right by turns to
<pb n="15" id="p15"/>
rub his chin, pull his wig at the ears, or point what he said, stood looking down into her face while she sat looking up into his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Manette, it <hi rend="italics">was</hi> I. And you will see how truly I spoke of myself just now, in saying I had no feelings, and that all the relations I hold with my fellow-creatures are mere business relations, when you reflect that I have never seen you since. No; you have been the ward of Tellson's House since, and I have been busy with the other business of Tellson's House since. Feelings! I have no time for them, no chance of them. I pass my whole life, miss, in turning an immense pecuniary Mangle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this odd description of his daily routine of employment, Mr. Lorry flattened his flaxen wig upon his head with both hands (which was most unnecessary, for nothing could be flatter than its shining surface was before), and resumed his former attitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far, miss (as you have remarked), this is the story of your regretted father. Now comes the difference. If your father had not died when he did&mdash;Don't be frightened! How you start!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did, indeed, start. And she caught his wrist with both her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray,&rdquo; said Mr. Lorry, in a soothing tone, bringing his left hand from the back of the chair to lay it on the supplicatory fingers that clasped him in so violent a tremble: &ldquo;pray control your agitation&mdash;a matter of business. As I was saying&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her look so discomposed him that he stopped, wandered, and began anew:</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I was saying; if Monsieur Manette had not died; if he had suddenly and silently disappeared; if he had been spirited away; if it had not been difficult to guess to what dreadful place, though no art could trace him; if he had an enemy in some compatriot who could exercise a privilege that I in my own time have known the boldest people afraid to speak of in a whisper, across the water, there; for instance, the privilege of filling up blank forms for the consignment of any one to the oblivion of a prison for any length of time; if his wife had implored the king, the queen, the court, the clergy, for any tidings of him, and all quite in vain;&mdash;then the history of your father would have been the history of this unfortunate gentleman, the Doctor of Beauvais.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I entreat you to tell me more, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will. I am going to. You can bear it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can bear anything but the uncertainty you leave me in at this moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You speak collectedly, and you&mdash;<hi rend="italics">are</hi> collected. That's good!&rdquo; (Though his manner was less satisfied than his words.) &ldquo;A matter of business. Regard it as a matter of business&mdash;business that must be done. Now, if this Doctor's wife, though a lady of great courage and spirit, had suffered so intensely from this cause before her little child was born&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The little child was a daughter, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A daughter. A&mdash;a&mdash;matter of business&mdash;don't be distressed. Miss, if the poor lady had suffered so intensely before her little child was born, that she came to the determination of sparing the poor child the inheritance of any part of the agony she had known the pains of, by rearing her in the belief that her father was dead&mdash;No, don't kneel! In Heaven's name why should you kneel to me!&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="16" id="p16"/>
<p>&ldquo;For the truth. O dear, good, compassionate sir, for the truth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&mdash;a matter of business. You confuse me, and how can I transact business if I am confused? Let us be clear-headed. If you could kindly mention now, for instance, what nine times ninepence are, or how many shillings in twenty guineas, it would be so encouraging. I should be so much more at my ease about your state of mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without directly answering to this appeal, she sat so still when he had very gently raised her, and the hands that had not ceased to clasp his wrists were so much more steady than they had been, that she communicated some reassurance to Mr. Jarvis Lorry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's right, that's right. Courage! Business! You have business before you; useful business. Miss Manette, your mother took this course with you. And when she died&mdash;I believe broken-hearted&mdash;having never slackened her unavailing search for your father, she left you, at two years old, to grow to be blooming, beautiful, and happy, without the dark could upon you of living in uncertainty whether your father soon wore his heart out in prison, or wasted there through many lingering years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he said the words, he looked down, with an admiring pity, on the flowing golden hair; as if he pictured to himself that it might have been already tinged with grey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know that your parents had no great possession, and that what they had was secured to your mother and to you. There has been no new discovery, of money, or of any other property; but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He felt his wrist held closer, and he stopped. The expression in the forehead, which had so particularly attracted his notice, and which was now immovable, had deepended into one of pain and horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he has been&mdash;been found. He is alive. Greatly changed, it is too probable; almost a wreck, it is possible; though we will hope the best. Still, alive. Your father has been taken to the house of an old servant in Paris, and we are going there: I, to identify him, if I can: you, to restore him to life, love, duty, rest, comfort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shiver ran through her frame, and from it through his. She said, in a low, distinct, awe-stricken voice, as if she were saying it in a dream,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to see his Ghost! It will be his Ghost&mdash;not him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Lorry quietly chafed the hands that held his arm. &ldquo;There, there, there! See now, see now! The best and the worst are known to you now. You are well on your way to the poor wronged gentleman, and, with a fair sea voyage, and a fair land journey, you will be soon at his dear side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She repeated in the same tone, sunk to a whisper, &ldquo;I have been free, I have been happy, yet his Ghost has never haunted me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one thing more,&rdquo; said Mr. Lorry, laying stress upon it as a wholesome means of enforcing her attention: &ldquo;he has been found under another name; his own, long forgotten or long concealed. It would be worse than useless now to inquire which; worse than useless to seek to know whether he has been for years overlooked, or always designedly held prisoner. It would be worse than useless now to make any inquiries, because it would be dangerous. Better not to mention the subject, anywhere or in any way, and to remove him&mdash;
<pb n="17" id="p17"/>
for a while at all events&mdash;out of France. Even I, safe as an Englishman, and even Tellson's, important as they are to French credit, avoid all naming of the matter. I carry about me, not a scrap of writing openly referring to it. This is a secret service altogether. My credentials, entries, and memoranda, are all comprehended in the one line, &lsquo;Recalled to Life;&rsquo; which may mean anything. But what is the matter! She doesn't notice a word! Miss Manette!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perfectly still and silent, and not even fallen back in her chair, she sat under his hand, utterly insensible; with her eyes open and fixed upon him, and with that last expression looking as if it were carved or branded into her forehead. So close was her hold upon his arm, that he feared to detach himself lest he should hurt her; therefore he called out loudly for assistance without moving.</p>
<p>A wild-looking woman, whom even in his agitation, Mr. Lorry observed to be all of a red colour, and to have red hair, and to be dressed in some extraordinary tight-fitting fashion, and to have on her head a most wonderful bonnet like a Grenadier wooden measure, and good measure too, or a great Stilton cheese, came running into the room in advance of the inn servants, and soon settled the question of his detachment from the poor young lady, by laying a brawny hand upon his chest, and sending him flying back against the nearest wall.</p>
<p>(&ldquo;I really think this must be a man!&rdquo; was Mr. Lorry's breathless reflection, simultaneously with his coming against the wall.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, look at you all!&rdquo; bawled this figure, addressing the inn servants. &ldquo;Why don't you go and fetch things, instead of standing there staring at me? I am not so much to look at, am I? Why don't you go and fetch things? I'll let you know, if you don't bring smelling-salts, cold water, and vinegar, quick, I will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was an immediate dispersal for these restoratives, and she softly laid the patient on a sofa, and tended her with great skill and gentleness: calling her &ldquo;my precious!&rdquo; and &ldquo;my bird!&rdquo; and spreading her golden hair aside over her shoulders with great pride and care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you in brown!&rdquo; she said, indignantly turning on Mr. Lorry; &ldquo;couldn't you tell her what you had to tell her, without frightening her to death? Look at her, with her pretty pale face and her cold hands. Do you call <hi
rend="italics">that</hi> being a Banker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Lorry was so exceedingly disconcerted by a question so hard to answer, that he could only look on, at a distance, with much feebler sympathy and humility, while the strong woman, having banished the inn servants under the mysterious penalty of &ldquo;letting them know&rdquo; something not mentioned if they stayed there, staring, recovered her charge by a regular series of gradations, and coaxed her to lay her drooping head upon her shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope she will do well now,&rdquo; said Mr. Lorry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No thanks to you in brown, if she does. My darling pretty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; said Mr. Lorry, after another pause of feeble sympathy and humility, &ldquo;that you accompany Miss Manette to France?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A likely thing, too!&rdquo; replied the strong woman. &ldquo;If it was ever intended that I should go across salt water, do you suppose Providence would have cast my lot in an island?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This being another question hard to answer, Mr. Jarvis Lorry withdrew to consider it.</p>

<head>CHAPTER V. <lb/> THE WINE-SHOP.</head>
<p>A LARGE cask of wine had been dropped and broken, in the street. The accident had happened in getting it out of a cart; the cask had tumbled out with a run, the hoops had burst, and it lay on the stones just outside the door of the wine-shop, shattered like a walnut-shell.</p>
<p>All the people within reach had suspended their business, or their idleness, to run to the spot and drink the wine. The rough, irregular stones of the street, pointing every way, and designed, one might have thought, expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them, had dammed it into little pools; these were surrounded, each by its own jostling group or crowd, according to its size. Some men kneeled down, made scoops of their two hands joined, and sipped, or tried to help women, who bent over their shoulders, to sip, before the wine had all run out between their fingers. Others, men and women, dipped in the puddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware, or even with handkerchiefs from women's heads, which were squeezed dry into infants' mouths; others made small mud-embankments, to stem the wine as it ran; others, directed by lookers-on up at high windows, darted here and there, to cut off little streams of wine that started away in new directions; others, devoted themselves to the sodden and lee-dyed pieces of the cask, licking, and even champing the moister wine-rotted fragments with eager relish. There was no drainage to carry off the wine, and not only did it all get taken up, but so much mud got taken up along with it, that there might have been a scavenger in the street, if anybody acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous presence.</p>
<p>A shrill sound of laughter and of amused voices&mdash;voices of men, women, and children&mdash;resounded in the street while this wine-game lasted. There was little roughness in the sport, and much playfulness. There was a special companionship in it, an observable inclination on the part of every one to join some other one, which led, especially among the luckier or lighter-hearted, to frolicsome embraces, drinking of healths, shaking of hands, and even joining of hands and dancing, a dozen together. When the wine was gone, and the places where it had been most abundant were raked into a gridiron-pattern by fingers, these demonstrations ceased, as suddenly as they had broken out. The man who had left his saw sticking in the firewood he was cutting, set it in motion again; the woman who had left on a door-step the little pot of hot-ashes, at which she had been trying to soften the pain in her own starved fingers and toes, or in those of her child, returned to it; men with bare arms, matted locks, and cadaverous faces, who had emerged into the winter light from cellars, moved away to descend again; and a gloom gathered on the scene that appeared more natural to it than sunshine.</p>
<p>The wine was red wine, and had stained the ground of the narrow street in the suburb of Saint Antoine, in Paris, where it was spilled.
<pb n="19" id="p19"/>
It had stained many hands, too, and many faces, and many naked feet, and many wooden shoes. The hands of the man who sawed the wood, left red marks on the billets; and the forehead of the woman who nursed her baby, was stained with the stain of the old rag she wound about her head again. Those who had been greedy with the staves of the cask, had acquired a tigerish smear about the mouth; and one tall joker so besmirched, his head more out of a long squalid bag of a nightcap than in it, scrawled upon a wall with his finger dipped in muddy wine lees&mdash;BLOOD.</p>
<p>The time was to come, when that wine too would be spilled on the street-stones, and when the stain of it would be red upon many there.</p>
<p>And now that the cloud settled on Saint Antoine, which a momentary gleam had driven from his sacred countenance, the darkness of it was heavy&mdash;cold, dirt, sickness, ignorance, and want, were the lords in waiting on the saintly presence&mdash;nobles of great power all of them; but, most especially the last. Samples of a people that had undergone a terrible grinding and re-grinding in the mill, and certainly not in the fabulous mill which ground old people young, shivered at every corner, passed in and out at every doorway, looked from every window, fluttered in every vestige of a garment that the wind shook. The mill which had worked them down, was the mill that grinds young people old; the children had ancient faces and grave voices; and upon them, and upon the grown faces, and ploughed into every furrow of age and coming up afresh, was the sign, Hunger. It was prevalent everywhere. Hunger was pushed out of the tall houses, in the wretched clothing that hung upon poles and lines; Hunger was patched into them with straw and rag and wood and paper; Hunger was repeated in every fragment of the small modicum of firewood that the man sawed off; Hunger stared down from the smokeless chimneys, and started up from the filthy street that had no offal, among its refuse, of anything to eat. Hunger was the inscription on the baker's shelves, written in every small loaf of his scanty stock of bad bread; at the sausage-shop, in every dead-dog preparation that was offered for sale. Hunger rattled its dry bones among the roasting chesnuts in the turned cylinder; Hunger was shred into atomies in every farthing porringer of husky chips of potato, fried with some reluctant drops of oil.</p>
<p>Its abiding-place was in all things fitted to it. A narrow winding street, full of offence and stench, with other narrow winding streets diverging, all peopled by rags and nightcaps, and all smelling of rags and nightcaps, and all visible things with a brooding look upon them that looked ill. In the hunted air of the people there was yet some wild-beast thought of the possibility of turning at bay. Depressed and slinking though they were, eyes of fire were not wanting among them; nor compressed lips, white with what they suppressed; nor foreheads knitted into the likeness of the gallows-rope they mused about enduring, or inflicting. The trade signs (and they were almost as many as the shops) were, all, grim illustrations of Want. The butcher and the porkman painted up, only the leanest scrags of meat; the baker, the coarsest of meagre loaves. The people rudely pictured as drinking in the wine-shops, croaked over their scanty measures of thin wine and beer, and were gloweringly confidential
<pb id="p20" n="20"/>
together. Nothing was represented in a flourishing condition, save tools and weapons; but, the cutler's knives and axes were sharp and bright, the smith's hammers were heavy, and the gunmaker's stock was murderous. The crippling stones of the pavement, with their many little reservoirs of mud and water, had no footways, but broke off abruptly at the doors. The kennel, to make amends, ran down the middle of the street&mdash;when it ran at all: which was only after heavy rains, and then it ran, by many eccentric fits, into the houses. Across the streets, at wide intervals, one clumsy lamp was slung by a rope and pulley; at night, when the lamplighter had let these down, and lighted, and hoisted them again, a feeble grove of dim wicks swung in a sickly manner overhead, as if they were at sea. Indeed they were at sea, and the ship and crew were in peril of tempest.</p>
<p>For, the time was to come, when the gaunt scarecrows of that region should have watched the lamplighter, in their idleness and hunger, so long, as to conceive the idea of improving on his method, and hauling up men by those ropes and pulleys, to flare upon the darkness of their condition. But, the time was not come yet; and every wind that blew over France shook the rags of the scarecrows in vain, for the birds, fine of song and feather, took no warning.</p>
<p>The wine-shop was a corner shop, better than most others in its appearance and degree, and the master of the wine-shop had stood outside it, in a yellow waistcoat and green breeches, looking on at the struggle for the lost wine. &ldquo;It's not my affair,&rdquo; said he, with a final shrug of his shoulders. &ldquo;The people from the market did it. Let them bring another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There, his eyes happening to catch the tall joker writing up his joke, he called to him across the way:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, then, my Gaspard, what do you do there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fellow pointed to his joke with immense significance, as is often the way with his tribe. It missed its mark, and completely failed, as is often the way with his tribe too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What now? Are you a subject for the mad-hospital?&rdquo; said the wine-shop keeper, crossing the road, and obliterating the jest with a handful of mud, picked up for the purpose, and smeared over it. &ldquo;Why do you write in the public streets? Is there&mdash;tell me thou&mdash;is there no other place to write such words in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his expostulation he dropped his cleaner hand (perhaps accidentally, perhaps not), upon the joker's heart. The joker rapped it with his own, took a nimble spring upward, and came down in a fantastic dancing attitude, with one of his stained shoes jerked off his foot into his hand, and held out. A joker of an extremely, not to say wolfishly, practical character, he looked, under those circumstances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put it on, put it on,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;Call wine, wine; and finish there.&rdquo; With that advice, he wiped his soiled hand upon the joker's dress, such as it was&mdash;quite deliberately, as having dirtied the hand on his account; and then recrossed the road and entered the wine-shop.</p>
<p>This wine-shop keeper was a bull-necked, martial-looking man of thirty, and he should have been of a hot temperament, for, although it was a bitter day, he wore no coat, but carried one slung over his
<pb n="21" id="p21"/>
shoulder. His shirt-sleeves were rolled up, too, and his brown arms were bare to the elbows. Neither did he wear anything more on his head than his own crisply-curling short dark hair. He was a dark man altogether, with good eyes and a good bold breadth between them. Good-humoured-looking on the whole, but implacable-looking, too; evidently a man of a strong resolution and a set purpose; a man not desirable to be met, rushing down a narrow pass with a gulf on either side, for nothing would turn the man.</p>
<p>Madame Defarge, his wife, sat in the shop behind the counter as he came in. Madame Defarge was a stout woman of about his own age, with a watchful eye that seldom seemed to look at anything, a large hand heavily ringed, a steady face, strong features, and great composure of manner. There was a character about Madame Defarge, from which one might have predicated that she did not often make mistakes against herself in any of the reckonings over which she presided. Madame Defarge being sensitive to cold, was wrapped in fur, and had a quantity of bright shawl twined about her head, though not to the concealment of her large ear-rings. Her knitting was before her, but she had laid it down to pick her teeth with a toothpick. Thus engaged, with her right elbow supported by her left hand, Madame Defarge said nothing when her lord came in, but coughed just one grain of cough. This, in combination with the lifting of her darkly defined eyebrows over her toothpick by the breadth of a line, suggested to her husband that he would do well to look round the shop among the customers, for any new customer who had dropped in while he stepped over the way.</p>
<p>The wine-shop keeper accordingly rolled his eyes about, until they rested upon an elderly gentleman and a young lady, who were seated in a corner. Other company were there: two playing cards, two playing dominoes, three standing by the counter lengthening out a short supply of wine. As he passed behind the counter, he took notice that the elderly gentleman said in a look to the young lady, &ldquo;This is our man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the devil do <hi rend="italics">you</hi> do in that galley there!&rdquo; said Monsieur Defarge to himself; &ldquo;I don't know you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, he feigned not to notice the two strangers, and fell into discourse with the triumvirate of customers who were drinking at the counter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How goes it, Jacques?&rdquo; said one of these three to Monsieur Defarge. &ldquo;Is all the spilt wine swallowed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every drop, Jacques,&rdquo; answered Monsieur Defarge.</p>
<p>When this interchange of christian name was effected, Madame Defarge, picking her teeth with her toothpick, coughed another grain of cough, and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not often,&rdquo; said the second of the three, addressing Monsieur Defarge, &ldquo;that many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine, or of anything but black bread and death. Is it not so, Jacques?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is so, Jacques,&rdquo; Monsieur Defarge returned.</p>
<p>At this second interchange of the christian name, Madame Defarge, still using her toothpick with profound composure, coughed another grain of cough, and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.</p>
<p>The last of the three now said his say, as he put down his empty drinking vessel and smacked his lips.</p>
<pb n="22" id="p22"/>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! So much the worse! A bitter taste it is that such poor cattle always have in their mouths, and hard lives they live, Jacques. Am I right, Jacques?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, Jacques,&rdquo; was the response of Monsieur Defarge.</p>
<p>This third interchange of the christian name was completed at the moment when Madame Defarge put her toothpick by, kept her eyebrows up, and slightly rustled in her seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold then! True!&rdquo; muttered her husband. &ldquo;Gentlemen&mdash;my wife!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three customers pulled off their hats to Madame Defarge, with three flourishes. She acknowledged their homage by bending her head, and giving them a quick look. Then she glanced in a casual manner round the wine-shop, took up her knitting with great apparent calmness and repose of spirit, and became absorbed in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said her husband, who had kept his bright eye observantly upon her, &ldquo;good day. The chamber, furnished bachelor-fashion, that you wished to see, and were inquiring for when I stepped out, is on the fifth floor. The doorway of the staircase gives on the little court-yard close to the left here,&rdquo; pointing with his hand, &ldquo;near to the window of my establishment. But, now that I remember, one of you has already been there, and can show the way. Gentlemen, adieu!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They paid for their wine, and left the place. The eyes of Monsieur Defarge were studying his wife at her knitting, when the elderly gentleman advanced from his corner, and begged the favour of a word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willingly, sir,&rdquo; said Monsieur Defarge, and quietly stepped with him to the door.</p>
<p>Their conference was very short, but very decided. Almost at the first word, Monsieur Defarge started and became deeply attentive. It had not lasted a minute, when he nodded and went out. The gentleman then beckoned to the young lady, and they, too, went out. Madame Defarge knitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows, and saw nothing.</p>
<p>Mr. Jarvis Lorry and Miss Manette, emerging from the wine-shop thus, joined Monsieur Defarge in the doorway to which he had directed his other company just before. It opened from a stinking little black court-yard, and was the general public entrance to a great pile of houses, inhabited by a great number of people. In the gloomy tile-paved entry to the gloomy tile-paved staircase, Monsieur Defarge bent down on one knee to the child of his old master, and put her hand to his lips. It was a gentle action, but not at all gently done; a very remarkable transformation had come over him in a few seconds. He had no good-humour in his face, nor any openness of aspect left, but had become a secret, angry, dangerous man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very high; it is a little difficult. Better to begin slowly.&rdquo; Thus, Monsieur Defarge, in a stern voice, to Mr. Lorry, as they began ascending the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he alone?&rdquo; the latter whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alone! God help him who should be with him!&rdquo; said the other, in the same low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he always alone, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="23" id="p23"/>
<p>&ldquo;Of his own desire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of his own necessity. As he was, when I first saw him after they found me and demanded to know if I would take him, and, at my peril, be discreet&mdash;as he was then, so he is now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is greatly changed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Changed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The keeper of the wine-shop stopped to strike the wall with his hand, and mutter a tremendous curse. No direct answer could have been half so forcible. Mr. Lorry's spirits grew heavier and heavier, as he and his two companions ascended higher and higher.</p>
<p>Such a staircase, with its accessories, in the older and more crowded part of Paris, would be bad enough now; but, at that time, it was vile indeed to unaccustomed and unhardened senses. Every little habitation within the great foul nest of one high building&mdash;that is to say, the room or rooms within every door that opened on the general staircase&mdash;left its own heap of refuse on its own landing, besides flinging other refuse from its own windows. The uncontrollable and hopeless mass of decomposition so engendered, would have polluted the air, even if poverty and deprivation had not loaded it with their intangible impurities; the two bad sources combined made it almost insupportable. Through such an atmosphere, by a steep dark shaft of dirt and poison, the way lay. Yielding to his own disturbance of mind, and to his young companion's agitation, which became greater every instant, Mr. Jarvis Lorry twice stopped to rest. Each of these stoppages was made at a doleful grating, by which any languishing good airs that were left uncorrupted, seemed to escape, and all spoilt and sickly vapours seemed to crawl in. Through the rusted bars, tastes, rather than glimpses, were caught of the jumbled neighbourhood; and nothing within range, nearer or lower than the summits of the two great towers of Notre-Dame had any promise on it of healthy life or wholesome aspirations.</p>
<p>At last, the top of the staircase was gained, and they stopped for the third time. There was yet an upper staircase, of a steeper inclination and of contracted dimensions, to be ascended, before the garret story was reached. The keeper of the wine-shop, always going a little in advance, and always going on the side which Mr. Lorry took, as though he dreaded to be asked any question by the young lady, turned himself about here, and, carefully feeling in the pockets of the coat he carried over his shoulder, took out a key.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The door is locked then, my friend?&rdquo; said Mr. Lorry, surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay. Yes,&rdquo; was the grim reply of Monsieur Defarge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think it necessary to keep the unfortunate gentleman so retired?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it necessary to turn the key.&rdquo; Monsieur Defarge whispered it closer in his ear, and frowned heavily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why! Because he has lived so long, locked up, that he would be frightened&mdash;rave&mdash;tear himself to pieces&mdash;die&mdash;come to I know not what harm&mdash;if his door was left open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it possible!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Lorry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it possible?&rdquo; repeated Defarge, bitterly. &ldquo;Yes. And a beautiful world we live in, when it <hi
rend="italics">is</hi> possible, and when many other such things are possible, and not only possible, but done&mdash;done, see
<pb n="24" id="p24"/>
you!&mdash;under that sky there, every day. Long live the Devil. Let us go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This dialogue had been held in so very low a whisper, that not a word of it had reached the young lady's ears. But, by this time she trembled under such strong emotion, and her face expressed such deep anxiety, and, above all, such dread and terror, that Mr. Lorry felt it incumbent on him to speak a word or two of reassurance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Courage, dear miss! Courage! Business! The worst will be over in a moment; it is but passing the room door, and the worst is over. Then, all the good you bring to him, all the relief, all the happiness you bring to him, begin. Let our good friend here, assist you on that side. That's well, friend Defarge. Come, now. Business, business!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went up slowly and softly. The staircase was short, and they were soon at the top. There, as it had an abrupt turn in it, they came all at once in sight of three men, whose heads were bent down close together at the side of a door, and who were intently looking into the room to which the door belonged, through some chinks or holes in the wall. On hearing footsteps close at hand, these three turned, and rose, and showed themselves to be the three of one name who had been drinking in the wine-shop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forgot them in the surprise of your visit,&rdquo; explained Monsieur Defarge. &ldquo;Leave us, good boys; we have business here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three glided by, and went silently down.</p>
<p>There appearing to be no other door on that floor, and the keeper of the wine-shop going straight to this one when they were left alone, Mr. Lorry asked him in a whisper, with a little anger:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you make a show of Monsieur Manette?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I show him, in the way you have seen, to a chosen few.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italics">I</hi> think it is well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are the few? How do you choose them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I choose them as real men, of my name&mdash;Jacques is my name&mdash;to whom the sight is likely to do good. Enough; you are English; that is another thing. Stay there, if you please, a little moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With an admonitory gesture to keep them back, he stooped, and looked in through the crevice in the wall. Soon raising his head again, he struck twice or thrice upon the door&mdash;evidently with no other object than to make a noise there. With the same intention, he drew the key across it, three or four times, before he put it clumsily into the lock, and turned it as heavily as he could.</p>
<p>The door slowly opened inward under his hand, and he looked into the room and said something. A faint voice answered something. Little more than a single syllable could have been spoken on either side.</p>
<p>He looked back over his shoulder, and beckoned them to enter. Mr. Lorry got his arm securely round the daughter's waist, and held her; for he felt that she was sinking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;business, business!&rdquo; he urged, with a moisture that was not of business shining on his cheek. &ldquo;Come in, come in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid of it,&rdquo; she answered, shuddering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of it? What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean of him. Of my father.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="25" id="p25"/>
<p>Rendered in a manner desperate, by her state and by the beckoning of their conductor, he drew over his neck the arm that shook upon his shoulder, lifted her a little, and hurried her into the room. He set her down just within the door, and held her, clinging to him.</p>
<p>Defarge drew out the key, closed the door, locked it on the inside, took out the key again, and held it in his hand. All this he did, methodically, and with as loud and harsh an accompaniment of noise as he could make. Finally, he walked across the room with a measured tread to where the window was. He stopped there, and faced round.</p>
<p>The garret, built to be a depository for firewood and the like, was dim and dark: for, the window of dormer shape, was in truth a door in the roof, with a little crane over it for the hoisting up of stores from the street: unglazed, and closing up the middle in two pieces, like any other door of French construction. To exclude the cold, one half of this door was fast closed, and the other was opened but a very little way. Such a scanty portion of light was admitted through these means, that it was difficult, on first coming in, to see anything; and long habit alone could have slowly formed in any one, the ability to do any work requiring nicety in such obscurity. Yet, work of that kind was being done in the garret; for, with his back towards the door, and his face towards the window where the keeper of the wine-shop stood looking at him, a white-haired man sat on a low bench, stooped forward and very busy, making shoes.</p>
</div3><div3>
<head>CHAPTER VI. <lb/> THE SHOEMAKER.</head>
<p>&ldquo;GOOD DAY!&rdquo; said Monsieur Defarge, looking down at the white head that bent low over the shoemaking.</p>
<p>It was raised for a moment, and a very faint voice responded to the salutation, as if it were at a distance:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are still hard at work, I see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a long silence, the head was lifted for another moment, and the voice replied, &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I am working.&rdquo; This time, a pair of haggard eyes had looked at the questioner, before the face had dropped again.</p>
<p>The faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful. It was not the faintness of physical weakness, though confinement and hard fare no doubt had their part in it. Its deplorable peculiarity was, that it was the faintness of solitude and disuse. It was like the last feeble echo of a sound made long and long ago. So entirely had it lost the life and resonance of the human voice, that it affected the senses like a once beautiful colour, faded away into a poor weak stain. So sunken and suppressed it was, that it was like a voice underground. So expressive it was, of a hopeless and lost creature, that a famished
<pb n="26" id="p26"/>
traveller, wearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness, would have remembered home and friends in such a tone before lying down to die.</p>
<p>Some minutes of silent work had passed, and the haggard eyes had looked up again: not with any interest or curiosity, but with a dull mechanical perception, beforehand, that the spot where the only visitor they were aware of had stood, was not yet empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want,&rdquo; said Defarge, who had not removed his gaze from the shoemaker, &ldquo;to let in a little more light here. You can bear a little more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shoemaker stopped his work; looked, with a vacant air of listening, at the floor on one side of him; then, similarly, at the floor on the other side of him; then, upward at the speaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can bear a little more light?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must bear it, if you let it in.&rdquo; (Laying the palest shadow of a stress upon the second word.)</p>
<p>The opened half-door was opened a little further, and secured at that angle for the time. A broad ray of light fell into the garret, and showed the workman, with an unfinished shoe upon his lap, pausing in his labour. His few common tools and various scraps of leather were at his feet and on his bench. He had a white beard, raggedly cut, but not very long, a hollow face, and exceedingly bright eyes. The hollowness and thinness of his face would have caused them to look large, under his yet dark eyebrows and his confused white hair, though they had been really otherwise; but, they were naturally large, and looked unnaturally so. His yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throat, and showed his body to be withered and worn. He, and his old canvas frock, and his loose stockings, and all his poor tatters of clothes, had, in a long seclusion from direct light and air, faded down to such a dull uniformity of parchment-yellow, that it would have been hard to say which was which.</p>
<p>He had put up a hand between his eyes and the light, and the very bones of it seemed transparent. So he sat, with a steadfastly vacant gaze, pausing in his work. He never looked at the figure before him, without first looking down on this side of himself, then on that, as if he had lost the habit of associating place with sound; he never spoke, without first wandering in this manner, and forgetting to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to finish that pair of shoes to-day?&rdquo; asked Defarge, motioning to Mr. Lorry to come forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to finish that pair of shoes to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can't say that I mean to. I suppose so. I don't know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, the question reminded him of his work, and he bent over it again.</p>
<p>Mr. Lorry came silently forward, leaving the daughter by the door. When he had stood, for a minute or two, by the side of Defarge, the shoemaker looked up. He showed no surprise at seeing another figure, but the unsteady fingers of one of his hands strayed to his lips as he looked at it (his lips and his nails were of the same pale lead-colour), and then the hand dropped to his work, and he once more bent over the shoe. The look and the action had occupied but an instant.</p>
<pb n="27" id="p27"/>
<p>&ldquo;You have a visitor, you see,&rdquo; said Monsieur Defarge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is a visitor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shoemaker looked up as before, but without removing a hand from his work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; said Defarge. &ldquo;Here is monsieur, who knows a wellmade shoe when he sees one. Show him that shoe you are working at. Take it, monsieur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Lorry took it in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell monsieur what kind of shoe it is, and the maker's name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a longer pause than usual, before the shoemaker replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forget what it was you asked me. What did you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said, couldn't you describe the kind of shoe, for monsieur's information?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a lady's shoe. It is a young lady's walking-shoe. It is in the present mode. I never saw the mode. I have had a pattern in my hand.&rdquo; He glanced at the shoe, with some little passing touch of pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the maker's name?&rdquo; said Defarge.</p>
<p>Now that he had no work to hold, he laid the knuckles of the right hand in the hollow of the left, and then the knuckles of the left hand in the hollow of the right, and then passed a hand across his bearded chin, and so on in regular changes, without a moment's intermission. The task of recalling him from the vacancy into which he always sank when he had spoken, was like recalling some very weak person from a swoon, or endeavouring, in the hope of some disclosure, to stay the spirit of a fast-dying man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ask me for my name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assuredly I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One Hundred and Five, North Tower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One Hundred and Five, North Tower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a weary sound that was not a sigh, nor a groan, he bent to work again, until the silence was again broken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not a shoemaker by trade?&rdquo; said Mr. Lorry, looking steadfastly at him.</p>
<p>His haggard eyes turned to Defarge as if he would have transferred the question to him; but as no help came from that quarter, they turned back on the questioner when they had sought the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not a shoemaker by trade? No, I was not a shoemaker by trade. I&mdash;I learnt it here. I taught myself. I asked leave to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lapsed away, even for minutes, ringing those measured changes on his hands the whole time. His eyes came slowly back, at last, to the face from which they had wandered; when they rested on it, he started, and resumed, in the manner of a sleeper that moment awake, reverting to a subject of last night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked leave to teach myself, and I got it with much difficulty after a long while, and I have made shoes ever since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he held out his hand for the shoe that had been taken from him, Mr. Lorry said, still looking steadfastly in his face:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur Manette, do you remember nothing of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shoe dropped to the ground, and he sat looking fixedly at the questioner.</p>
<pb n="28" id="p28"/>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur Manette;&rdquo; Mr. Lorry laid his hand upon Defarge's arm; &ldquo;do you remember nothing of this man? Look at him. Look at me. Is there no old banker, no old business, no old servant, no old time, rising in your mind, Monsieur Manette?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the captive of many years sat looking fixedly, by turns at Mr. Lorry and at Defarge, some long-obliterated marks of an actively intent intelligence in the middle of the forehead, gradually forced themselves through the black mist that had fallen on him. They were overclouded again, they were fainter, they were gone; but, they had been there. And so exactly was the expression repeated on the fair young face of her who had crept along the wall to a point where she could see him, and where she now stood looking at him, with hands which at first had been only raised in frightened compassion, if not even to keep him off and shut out the sight of him, but which were now extending towards him, trembling with eagerness to lay the spectral face upon her warm young breast, and love it back to life and hope&mdash;so exactly was the expression repeated (though in stronger characters) on her fair young face, that it looked as though it had passed, like a moving light, from him to her.</p>
<p>Darkness had fallen on him in its place. He looked at the two, less and less attentively, and his eyes in gloomy abstraction sought the ground and looked about him in the old way. Finally, with a deep long sigh, he took the shoe up, and resumed his work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you recognised him, monsieur?&rdquo; asked Defarge, in a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; for a moment. At first I thought it quite hopeless, but I have unquestionably seen, for a single moment, the face that I once knew well. Hush! Let us draw further back. Hush!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had moved from the wall of the garret, very near to the bench on which he sat. There was something awful in his unconsciousness of the figure that could have put out its hand and touched him as he stooped over his labour.</p>
<p>Not a word was spoken, not a sound was made. She stood, like a spirit, beside him, and he bent over his work.</p>
<p>It happened, at length, that he had occasion to change the instrument in his hand, for his shoemaker's knife. It lay on that side of him which was not the side on which she stood. He had taken it up, and was stooping to work again, when his eyes caught the skirt of her dress. He raised them, and saw her face. The two spectators started forward, but she stayed them with a motion of her hand. She had no fear of his striking at her with the knife, though they had.</p>
<p>He stared at her with a fearful look, and after a while his lips began to form some words, though no sound proceeded from them. By degrees, in the pauses of his quick and laboured breathing, he was heard to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the tears streaming down her face, she put her two hands to her lips, and kissed them to him; then clasped them on her breast, as if she laid his ruined head there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not the gaoler's daughter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sighed &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="29" id="p29"/>
<p>Not yet trusting the tones of her voice, she sat down on the bench beside him. He recoiled, but she laid her hand upon his arm. A strange thrill struck him when she did so, and visibly passed over his frame; he laid the knife down softly, as he sat staring at her.</p>
<p>Her golden hair, which she wore in long curls, had been hurriedly pushed aside, and fell down over her neck. Advancing his hand by little and little, he took it up, and looked at it. In the midst of the action he went astray, and, with another deep sigh, fell to work at his shoemaking.</p>
<p>But, not for long. Releasing his arm, she laid her hand upon his shoulder. After looking doubtfully at it, two or three times, as if to be sure that it was really there, he laid down his work, put his hand to his neck, and took off a blackened string with a scrap of folded rag attached to it. He opened this, carefully, on his knee, and it contained a very little quantity of hair: not more than one or two long golden hairs, which he had, in some old day, wound off upon his finger.</p>
<p>He took her hair into his hand again, and looked closely at it. &ldquo;It is the same. How can it be! When was it! How was it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the concentrating expression returned to his forehead, he seemed to become conscious that it was in hers too. He turned her full to the light, and looked at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She had laid her head upon my shoulder, that night when I was summoned out&mdash;she had a fear of my going, though I had none&mdash;and when I was brought to the North Tower they found these upon my sleeve. &lsquo;You will leave me them? They can never help me to escape in the body, though they may in the spirit.&rsquo; Those were the words I said. I remember them very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He formed this speech with his lips many times before he could utter it. But when he did find spoken words for it, they came to him coherently, though slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was this?&mdash;<hi rend="italics">Was it you?</hi>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more, the two spectators started, as he turned upon her with a frightful suddenness. But, she sat perfectly still in his grasp, and only said, in a low voice, &ldquo;I entreat you, good gentlemen, do not come near us, do not speak, do not move!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Whose voice was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His hands released her as he uttered this cry, and went up to his white hair, which they tore in a frenzy. It died out, as everything but his shoemaking did die out of him, and he refolded his little packet and tried to secure it in his breast; but, he still looked at her, and gloomily shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, no; you are too young, too blooming. It can't be. See what the prisoner is. These are not the hands she knew, this is not the face she knew, this is not a voice she ever heard. No, no. She was&mdash;and He was&mdash;before the slow years of the North Tower&mdash;ages ago. What is your name, my gentle angel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Heiling his softened tone and manner, his daughter fell upon her knees before him, with her appealing hands upon his breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, sir, at another time you shall know my name, and who my mother was, and who my father, and how I never knew their hard, hard history. But I cannot tell you at this time, and I cannot tell you here. All that I may tell you, here and now, is, that I pray to
<pb id="p30" n="30"/>
you to touch me and to bless me. Kiss me, kiss me! O my dear, my dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His cold white head mingled with her radiant hair, which warmed and lighted it as though it were the light of Freedom shining on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you hear in my voice&mdash;I don't know that it is so, but I hope it is&mdash;if you hear in my voice any resemblance to a voice that once was sweet music in your ears, weep for it, weep for it! If you touch, in touching my hair, anything that recals a beloved head that lay in your breast when you were young and free, weep for it, weep for it! If, when I hint to you of a Home there is before us, where I will be true to you with all my duty and with all my faithful service, I bring back the remembrance of a Home long desolate, while your poor heart pined away, weep for it, weep for it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She held him closer round the neck, and rocked him on her breast like a child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If, when I tell you, dearest dear, that your agony is over, and that I have come here to take you from it, and that we go to England to be at peace and at rest, I cause you to think of your useful life laid waste, and of our native France so wicked to you, weep for it, weep for it! And if, when I shall tell you of my name, and of my father who is living, and of my mother who is dead, you learn that I have to kneel to my honoured father, and implore his pardon for having never for his sake striven all day and lain awake and wept all night, because the love of my poor mother hid his torture from me, weep for it, weep for it! Weep for her, then, and for me! Good gentlemen, thank God! I feel his sacred tears upon my face, and his sobs strike against my heart. O, see! Thank God for us, thank God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had sunk in her arms, with his face dropped on her breast: a sight so touching, yet so terrible in the tremendous wrong and suffering which had gone before it, that the two beholders covered their faces.</p>
<p>When the quiet of the garret had been long undisturbed, and his heaving breast and shaken form had long yielded to the calm that must follow all storms&mdash;emblem to humanity, of the rest and silence into which the storm called Life must hush at last&mdash;they came forward to raise the father and daughter from the ground. He had gradually drooped to the floor, and lay there in a lethargy, worn out. She had nestled down with him, that his head might lie upon her arm; and her hair drooping over him curtained him from the light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If, without disturbing him,&rdquo; she said, raising her hand to Mr. Lorry as he stooped over them, after repeated blowings of his nose, &ldquo;all could be arranged for our leaving Paris at once, so that, from the very door, he could be taken away&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, consider. Is he fit for the journey?&rdquo; asked Mr. Lorry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More fit for that, I think, than to remain in this city, so dreadful to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said Defarge, who was kneeling to look on and hear. &ldquo;More than that; Monsieur Manette is, for all reasons, best out of France. Say, shall I hire a carriage and post-horses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's business,&rdquo; said Mr. Lorry, resuming on the shortest notice his methodical manners; &ldquo;and if business is to be done, I had better do it.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="31" id="p31"/>
<p>&ldquo;Then be so kind,&rdquo; urged Miss Manette, &ldquo;as to leave us here. You see how composed he has become, and you cannot be afraid to leave him with me now. Why should you be? If you will lock the door to secure us from interruption, I do not doubt that you will find him, when you come back, as quiet as you leave him. In any case, I will take care of him until you return, and then we will remove him straight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both Mr. Lorry and Defarge were rather disinclined to this course, and in favour of one of them remaining. But, as there were not only carriage and horses to be seen to, but travelling papers; and as time pressed, for the day was drawing to an end, it came at last to their hastily dividing the business that was necessary to be done, and hurrying away to do it.</p>
<p>Then, as the darkness closed in, the daughter laid her head down on the hard ground close at the father's side, and watched him. The darkness deepened and deepened, and they both lay quiet, until a light gleamed through the chinks in the wall.</p>
<p>Mr. Lorry and Monsieur Defarge had made all ready for the journey, and had brought with them, besides travelling cloaks and wrappers, bread and meat, wine, and hot coffee. Monsieur Defarge put this provender, and the lamp he carried, on the shoemaker's bench (there was nothing else in the garret but a pallet bed), and he and Mr. Lorry roused the captive, and assisted him to his feet.</p>
<p>No human intelligence could have read the mysteries of his mind, in the scared blank wonder of his face. Whether he knew what had happened, whether he recollected what they had said to him, whether he knew that he was free, were questions which no sagacity could have solved. They tried speaking to him; but, he was so confused, and so very slow to answer, that they took fright at his bewilderment, and agreed for the time to tamper with him no more. He had a wild, lost manner of occasionally clasping his head in his hands, that had not been seen in him before; yet, he had some pleasure in the mere sound of his daughter's voice, and invariably turned to it when she spoke.</p>
<p>In the submissive way of one long accustomed to obey under coercion, he ate and drank what they gave him to eat and drink, and put on the cloak and other wrappings that they gave him to wear. He readily responded to his daughter's drawing her arm through his, and took&mdash;and kept&mdash;her hand in both of his own.</p>
<p>They began to descend; Monsieur Defarge going first with the lamp, Mr. Lorry closing the little procession. They had not traversed many steps of the long main staircase when he stopped, and stared at the roof and round at the walls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember the place, my father? You remember coming up here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, before she could repeat the question, he murmured an answer as if she had repeated it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember? No, I don't remember. It was so very long ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That he had no recollection whatever of his having been brought from his prison to that house, was apparent to them. They heard him mutter, &ldquo;One Hundred and Five, North Tower;&rdquo; and when he
<pb n="32" id="p32"/>
looked about him, it evidently was for the strong fortress-walls which had long encompassed him. On their reaching the court-yard, he instinctively altered his tread, as being in expectation of a drawbridge; and when there was no drawbridge, and he saw the carriage waiting in the open street, he dropped his daughter's hand and clasped his head again.</p>
<p>No crowd was about the door; no people were discernible at any of the many windows; not even a chance passer-by was in the street. An unnatural silence and desertion reigned there. Only one soul was to be seen, and that was Madame Defarge&mdash;who leaned against the door-post, knitting, and saw nothing.</p>
<p>The prisoner had got into the coach, and his daughter had followed him, when Mr. Lorry's feet were arrested on the step by his asking, miserably, for his shoemaking tools and the unfinished shoes. Madame Defarge immediately called to her husband that she would get them, and went, knitting, out of the lamplight, through the court-yard. She quickly brought them down and handed them in;&mdash;and immediately afterwards leaned against the door-post, knitting, and saw nothing.</p>
<p>Defarge got upon the box, and gave the word &ldquo;To the Barrier!&rdquo; The postilion cracked his whip, and they clattered away under the feeble over-swinging lamps.</p>
<p>Under the over-swinging lamps&mdash;swinging ever brighter in the better streets, and ever dimmer in the worse&mdash;and by lighted shops, gay crowds, illuminated coffee-houses, and theatre doors, to one of the city gates. Soldiers with lanterns, at the guard-house there. &ldquo;Your papers, travellers!&rdquo; &ldquo;See here then, Monsieur the Officer,&rdquo; said Defarge, getting down, and taking him gravely apart, &ldquo;these are the papers of monsieur inside, with the white head. They were consigned to me, with him, at the&mdash;&rdquo; He dropped his voice, there was a flutter among the military lanterns, and one of them being handed into the coach by an arm in uniform, the eyes connected with the arm looked, not an every day or an every night look, at monsieur with the white head. &ldquo;It is well. Forward!&rdquo; from the uniform. &ldquo;Adieu!&rdquo; from Defarge. And so, under a short grove of feebler and feebler over-swinging lamps, out under the great grove of stars.</p>
<p>Beneath that arch of unmoved and eternal lights: some, so remote from this little earth that the learned tell us it is doubtful whether their rays have even yet discovered it, as a point in space where anything is suffered or done: the shadows of the night were broad and black. All through the cold and restless interval, until dawn, they once more whispered in the ears of Mr. Jarvis Lorry&mdash;sitting opposite the buried man who had been dug out, and wondering what subtle powers were for ever lost to him, and what were capable of restoration&mdash;the old inquiry:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you care to be recalled to life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the old answer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can't say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>DR. DE JONGH, an eminent Dutch Physician, has, as is well known, devoted himself for upwards of sixteen years to a series of scientific researches into the nature and properties of Cod Liver Oil. His works recording these investigations have been translated into most of the European languages; by universal admission, they are regarded by the Faculty as the standard authority upon the subject; and in addition to the spontaneous approval and highly flattering testimonials from some of the most distinguished medical men and scientific chemists of Europe&mdash;amongst whom may be enumerated the illustrious LIEBIG, of the University of Giessen, the renowned Swedish Chemist, BERZELIUS, and the celebrated Physician, BARON FOUQUIER, of the University of Paris&mdash;DR. DE JONGH has been rewarded by his Majesty LEOPOLD I., the King of the Belgians, with the dignity of a Knight of the Order of Leopold, and the large Gold Medal of Merit, and by his Majesty WILLIAM II., the King of the Netherlands, with a Silver Medal specially struck for the purpose.</p>
<p>Extensive use upon the Continent for many years has gained for DR. DE JONGH'S Oil the highest repute, and professional and general appreciation. Since its introduction into this country it has secured the entire confidence of the most eminent members of the British medical profession, and has obtained, notwithstanding the active and in many instances unscrupulous opposition of interested dealers, an unprecedented amount of public patronage.</p>
<p>DR. DE JONGH'S elaborate chemical investigations and therapeutical experiments with the several kinds of Cod Liver Oil have demonstrated the superior efficacy of this pure Light Brown Oil, which effects a cure, relieves symptoms, and alleviates suffering in a much shorter time than the Pale Oil: iodine, phosphate of lime, volatile fatty acids, and the elements of the bile&mdash;imparting the colour to the Oil, and deemed amongst its most active and essential principles&mdash;being invariably present in much larger quantities than in the Pale Oils manufactured in England and Newfoundland, which, by their mode of preparation, are in a great measure deprived of these active properties.</p>
<p>In taste and odour DR. DE JONGH'S OIL is not disagreeable or repulsive; it is easily taken by the most delicate invalid or child; creates no nausea or after-taste; is borne with facility, and not rejected by the stomach; and does not irritate or disturb the organs, but improves the functions of digestion and assimilation.</p>
<p>Its medicinal properties are found, in practice, to be infinitely greater than those of the ordinary Cod Liver Oil, and it produces beneficial results and effects a cure in a much shorter period. In innumerable cases DR. DE JONGH'S OIL has afforded immediate mitigation of symptoms, arrested disease, and restored health, where other kinds of Cod Liver Oil had been long and copiously administered with little or no benefit.</p>
<p>In use it is not so expensive as any Oil sold as genuine by respectable Chemists, whilst its active properties, more rapid effects, the smaller doses required, and its uniform purity and certainty of operation, render it far preferable and more really economical than that which is offered at the lowest price. <hi
rend="italics">This latter consideration is particularly worthy the attention of all who, from motives of apparent cheapness, may be induced inadvertently to recommend or purchase an inferior or spurious preparation.</hi></p>

<head>PRINCIPAL MALADIES IN WHICH DR. DE JONGH'S COD LIVER OIL HAS <lb/> BEEN SUCCESSFULLY PRESCRIBED.</head><div3>
<head>CONSUMPTION AND DISEASES OF THE CHEST AND THROAT.</head>
<p>The extraordinary virtues of this medicine in tubercular consumption, a disease long allowed to be one of the <hi
rend="italics">opprobria medicine,</hi> may now be considered as fully established. Administered in time, and steadily persevered in, it has not only the power of subduing all disposition to phthisis, but of arresting the development of tubercles; or, when the disease has advanced to the developed from, it has accomplished, in numerous instances, a perfect cure. In the last stage, it is, at all events, the best palliative means of allaying the urgent symptoms, and even when a complete cure is not produced, it may for years prolong life and render it more supportable. No remedy so rapidly restores the exhausted strength, improves the nutritive functions, stops or diminishes emaciation, checks the perspiration, quiets the cough and expectoration, or produces a more marked and favourable influence on the local malady. Hospital, dispensary, and private practice, all furnish innumerable cases in which the administration of this remedy has been attended with the happiest results. To quote the eloquent words of the Rev. C. D. BADHAM, M.D., the gifted author of &ldquo;Ancient and Modern Fish Tattle:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<q><p>&ldquo;With what still greater wonder and complacency must every enlightened physician, now-a-days, contemplate that wholly unexpected and invaluable ally which suffering lungs have recently secured from the iatric liver of the cod. <hi
rend="italics">Alers flammam</hi>&mdash;to feed common lamps&mdash;was, till lately, all it professed to do; but now its vaunt is, <hi
rend="italics">alere vitam</hi>&mdash;to replenish the lamp of life when burning low, and threatening to go out. Thousands of cases hitherto most unpromising, have, under its auspices, suddenly changed their aspect, and looked bright: here, a fair girl hastening to decay, had scarcely taken a few doses, when the ominous cough was appeased, she recovered her roses, smiled once more on a reassured family of friends, and went on her way rejoicing; there, a case of graver import, which had whispered death to the inquiring car, made a stand, rallied, and consumption was, for the time, arrested in mid-course; and again, in patients still further reduced by the blighting malady, the administration of the bland Oil was frequently observed to respite, soften, and assuage sufferings beyond its power to remove. Scepticism, by slow degrees, made way to conviction; and he who, a few years ago, would justly have passed for a quack who should have pretended to cure consumption, is now countenanced everywhere by brother practitioners, who have all the same story to tell, till the world at large has become convinced of the fact; and there is now not a village apothecary through the length and breadth of our isle who has not himself witnessed some of the endless beneficent wonders which this penetrating balm, under the Divine blessing, has already worked, and is daily working, among the children of men.&rdquo;</p></q>
<p>In non-tubercular pulmonary disease, so prevalent, especially among the industrial population, who are exposed to abrupt vicissitudes of heat and cold, and to the mechanical irritation produced in the respiratory organs by the impregnation of the air of mines and manufactories with earthy or metallic particles, or with dust emanating from flax, cotton, or wool, the soothing and reparative action of DR. DE JONGH'S Oil subdues the chronic inflammation of the lungs, and effectually arrests the progress of the malady.</p>
<p>The same beneficial results attend the administration of this Oil in many chronic affections of the throat as in pulmonary diseases. M. CHAMPOUILLON, the celebrated French Physician of the Hospital of Val de Gr&acirc;ce, asserts, from considerable experience, that this Oil is most effectual in curing chronic bronchitis. No remedy so speedily allays, and permanently cures, the distressing irritation which provokes frequent and prolonged coughing. The actual benefit derived is thus conclusively stated by ARTHUR CRIDLAND, Esq., an eminent surgeon in extensive practice at Brighton:&mdash;</p>
<q><p>&ldquo;The effect of DR. DE JONGH'S Cod Liver Oil on myself in the latter stage of whooping cough, last winter, was remarkable. I suffered from excessive irritation of the larynx; consequently, I was greatly reduced in strength and appearance, and quite unable to attend to my professional duties. It occurred to me that the Oil which I was frequently prescribing would benefit my own case, and, after taking it a few days, its good effect commenced, and at the end of six weeks I regained my usual health and strength, and had entirely lost the laryngial irritation, which was of a most harassing and fearfully distressing character.</p><p>&ldquo;It is therefore with much pleasure I beg to add my testimony to the excellent results attendant on DR. DE JONGH'S Oil.&rdquo;</p></q>
</div3><div3>
<head>GENERAL DEBILITY AND EMACIATION.</head>
<p>To maintain health, or to avert the access or development of disorders to which there is a constitutional predisposition, as well as to impart strength in old age, convalescence, or natural feebleness, DR. DE JONGH'S Oil has been used with the greatest benefit. In cases of prostration and emaciation, produced by long sickness, by exposure to the influence of tropical climates or vicissitudes of temperature, to a cold, humid, or vitiated atmosphere, in fenny and marshy countries, unhealthy manufactories and mines, or where excessive labour, fatigue, bad nourishment, and other hardships, have reduced the vital forces, and where life appeared to be even at its lowest ebb, the reparative and restorative powers of this Oil have been remarkably manifested. According to TAUFFLIER, BEEFELD, CAREY, and other eminent physicians, its action appears to be different from that of the ordinary tonics properly so called, and it has, in consequence, been resorted to with the most beneficial effect after the whole range of these had been in vain exhausted.</p>
<p>By its administration the failing physical powers of advancing age are renewed, the natural appetite is revived, and the functions of digestion and assimilation improved and regulated, and when its use is steadily persevered in, from its peculiarly nutritious and tonic properties, it swiftly restores flesh to the most emaciated frame, and imparts health and strength to the most feeble and deteriorated constitution. These peculiar characteristics of DR. DE JONGH'S Oil are thus described by HENRY HANKS, Esq., a distinguished London practitioner:&mdash;</p>
<q><p>&ldquo;The superior efficacy of DR. DE JONGH'S Light-Brown Cod Liver Oil over the Pale Cod Liver Oil has proved, in my experience, unequivocal.</p><p>&ldquo;Patients who have persisted for several months in the use of the latter, with scarcely any perceptible improvement, have, after a brief trial of DR. DE JONGH'S Light-Brown Cod Liver Oil, acquired such fatness, and those distressing symptoms accompanying emaciation have so rapidly subsided, that I have been induced to confide in its reputed remedial powers, and, consequently to advise its substitution for the Pale Cod Liver Oil.&rdquo;</p></q>
</div3><div3>
<pb id="pviii" n="viii"/>
<head>DISORDERS OF INFANCY, CHILDHOOD, AND ADOLESCENCE.</head>
<p>In those severe disorders, infantile wasting, rickets, and mesenteric disease or swelling of the belly, DR. DE JONGH'S Cod Liver Oil, whether the disease be at its commencement or at its height, will supersede every other means of cure, and will accomplish whatever can be expected or hoped for from any medicine. The learned German Physician BREFELD, gives the following description of its operation:&mdash;</p>
<q><p>&ldquo;The healing virtue of this Oil in these forms of disease is as incredible as it is unlimited in its effects. Even in the very extremity of life, where the patient appears to be sinking, and death inevitable, it affords relief as a matter of certainty. I know nothing to controvert this, except an intervening attack of acute fever and the termination of life, the death-struggle itself. It moderates slow fever and diarrh&oelig;a as well as the other symptoms of rickets, which one after the other are gradually dispersed. It improves digestion and the consequent nourishment of the body; the tumid belly softens and diminishes in size as the wasted extremities begin to recover their rotundity. The old features again become natural and childish; the skin moist and clear; the powers of life are restored; the eyes are again full of life and brightness; the slow fever disappears; the childish gaiety re-establishes itself; with a return of healthy sound sleep, and removal of that anxious nightly starting and shrieking which render the night so wretched to the infant. With the increasing strength the desire and ability to stand and to walk return; and the unnatural state of the bonos, both in from and strength, by degrees is corrected.</p><p>&ldquo;As an anthelmintic the Oil is a most excellent adjuvant, by which the worms are dislodged, both mildly and effectually.&rdquo;</p></q>
<p>In that precarious and distressing state where the child may be sickly and feeble without being actually ill, the surprising efficacy of DR. DE JONGH'S Oil is thus described by the distinguished Physician, DR. EDWARD CAREY:&mdash;</p>
<q><p>&ldquo;It is in the diseases incidental to childhood that mainly depend on the mal-assimilation of the food in the pale cachectic child, when the anxious practitioner has exhausted the whole range of alteratives and tonics, that this Cod Liver Oil will come in and satisfy his most sanguine expectations. Where the powers of life are low, it affords nourishment to the body when none other can be borne; it furnishes the frame with fat in a truly wonderful manner; and, administered as it is in Holland, to the delicate and puny child, who, though not considered ill, is in that state of impaired health which would favour the development of disease, its extraordinary effects will soon be visible, after having taken it for a short period, by an appearance of health and strength which was before unknown, and which will be accomplished by no other remedy with which we are at present acquainted.&rdquo;</p></q>
<p>The remedial virtues of DR. DE JONGH'S Oil in cases of hereditary weakness or deficient nutrition, the prolific causes of convulsive affections and many fatal disorders of children, are thus recorded in the <hi
rend="italics">Medical Times and Gazette</hi>:&mdash;</p>
<q><p>&ldquo;In badly nourished infants DR. DE JONGH'S Light-Brown Cod Liver Oil is invaluable. The rapidity with which two or three teaspoonfuls per diem will fatten a young child is truly astonishing. The weight gained is three times the weight of the Oil swallowed, or more; and, as children like the taste of the Oil, and when it is given them often cry for more, it appears as though there were some prospect of deliverance for the appalling multitude of children who figure in the weekly bills of mortality issued from the office of the Registrar-General.&rdquo;</p></q>
<p>In checking a tendency to consumption and general debility at that age when a too rapid growth in the young renders the constitution fragile, and weakens the powers of assimilation and nutrition, this Oil has been found singularly efficacious. DR. PRUYS VAN DER HOEVEN, the eminent Physician of Leyden, states:&mdash;</p>
<q><p>&ldquo;I have given it to boys whose form of chest, delicate skin, and disposition to catarrh, showed a phthisical habit, and it has, in conjunction with dietetic and gymnastic rules, not only improved the delicate appearance, but has removed the obstinate cough. I have administered it to young people who grow tall exceedingly quickly, and have in all cases found it a most powerful restorative.&rdquo;</p></q>
</div3><div3>
<head>DISEASES OF THE SKIN.</head>
<p>In these distressing and unsightly complaints, which oftentimes tenaciously resist for years the whole Pharmacop&oelig;ia of alteratives and tonics, combined with every available ointment and lotion, the curative effects of DR. DE JONGH'S Oil, after a few weeks' administration, in the most inveterate cases, have been so remarkable, that this safe and simple remedy is now regarded as a specific in the most prevalent chronic cutaneous affections.</p>
<p>It will be sufficient to quote the following opinion of THOMAS HUNT, Esq., Surgeon to the Western Dispensary for Diseases of the Skin, and the eminent writer on cutaneous disorders, who, in his popular work, &ldquo;Guide to the Treatment of Diseases of the Skin,&rdquo; observes:&mdash;</p>
<q><p>&ldquo;If there is any one medicine which is at all to be compared with arsenic in its power over skin diseases, that medicine is the Cod Liver Oil sold in bottles as DR. DE JONGH'S Oil. As there is no medicine in the market more grossly adulterated than what is called Cod Liver Oil, I insist upon my patients procuring this article, which I know to be genuine, not only by analysis, but by the invariably satisfactory operation of the medicine in very small doses, in the cases to which it is appropriate. These are chiefly those accompanied with wasting of the flesh, from whatever cause, mal-assimilation, defective nutrition, variable appetite, deficient food, strumous disease, &amp;c. The cutaneous diseases most benefited by the Oil may be cited in the following order&mdash;strumous sores, sycosis, lapus, acne, prurigo, lichen, eczema.&rdquo;</p></q>
</div3><div3>
<head>SCROFULA AND SCROFULOUS DISORDERS</head>
<p>All who have prescribed this Oil have unanimously acknowledged its virtues in every form of scrofula, and bestowed upon it the highest praise, which has secured it the first place amongst anti-scrofulous remedies. It eradicates the first trace of the disease, and prevents its development and formation.</p>
<q><p>BREFELD says, &ldquo;There is no remedy which at all approaches its therapeutic properties in scrofulous disease; it is an undoubted powerful medicine, operating in a peculiar specific manner, and affording relief where, to all appearance, and according to former experience, the disorder was beyond the reach of medicine.&rdquo;</p><p>KOPP states, &ldquo;The first time the Cod Liver Oil is prescribed for a scrofulous patient, its favourable effects are soon apparent, and which can only be attributed to its use, frequently acting in a truly wonderful manner. It effects a change in the general appearance; the cachectic colour is lost, the flabby flesh becomes firm, the chain of swollen glands diminish and separate, and ulcers put on a healthy character and heal.&rdquo;</p></q>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Sir,&mdash;I was very glad to find from you, when I had the pleasure of seeing you in London, that you were interested commercially in Cod Liver Oil. It was fitting that the Author of the best analysis and investigations into the properties of this Oil should himself be the Purveyor of this important medicine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel, however, some diffidence in venturing to fulfil your request, by giving you my opinion of the quality of the Oil of which you gave me a sample; because I know that no one can be better, and few so well, acquainted with the physical and chemical properties of this medicine as yourself, whom I regard as the highest authority on the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can, however, have no hesitation about the propriety of responding to your application. The Oil which you gave me was of the very finest quality, whether considered with reference to its colour, flavour, or chemical properties; and I am satisfied that, for medicinal purposes, no finer Oil can be procured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With my best wishes for your success, believe me, my dear Sir, to be very faithfully yours,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Granville has used DR. DE JONGH'S Light-Brown Cod Liver Oil extensively in his practice, and has found it not only efficacious, but uniform in its qualities. He believes it to be preferable in many respects to Oils sold without the guarantee of such an authority as De Jongh. Dr. Granville has found that this particular kind produces the desired effect in a shorter time than others, and that it does not cause the nausea and indigestion too often consequent on the administration of the pale Newfoundland Oils. The Oil being, moreover, much more palatable, Dr. Granville's patients have themselves expressed a preference for DR. DE JONGH'S Light-Brown Cod Liver Oil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Cowan is glad to find that the Profession has some reasonable guarantee for a genuine article. The material now sold varies in almost every establishment where it is purchased, and a tendency to prefer a colourless and tasteless Oil, if not counteracted, will ultimately jeopardize the reputation of an unquestionably valuable addition to the Materia Medica.

<p>&ldquo;I have no hesitation in saying that I generally prefer your Cod Liver Oil, for the following reasons:&mdash;I have found it to agree better with the digestive organs, especially in those patients who consider themselves to be bilious; it seldom causes nausea or eructation; it is more palatable to most patients than the other kinds of Cod Liver Oil; it is stronger, and consequently a smaller dose is sufficient.&rdquo;</p>

<pb id="p1b" n="1"/><head>THE <lb/> MORISONIAN MONUMENT, <lb/> ERECTED IN FRONT OF THE <lb/> BRITISH COLLEGE OF HEALTH, <lb/> EUSTON ROAD, LONDON. <lb/> THE 31st OF MARCH, 1856.</head>
<p>THIS MEMORIAL, <lb/> RAISED BY A PENNY SUBSCRIPTION, <lb/> HAS BEEN ERECTED A.D. 1856.</p>
<p>TO <lb/> JAMES MORISON, <lb/> THE HYGEIST.</p>
<div2 type="section">
<head>REASONS FOR THE MONUMENT: BY JOHN FRASER, <lb/> 71, PRINCE'S STREET, EDINBURGH.</head>
<p>FRIENDS,&mdash;You will have perceived by the <hi rend="italics">Hygeist,</hi> that a proposal, emanating originally from Hygeists themselves, has for some time been before the public, to erect a monument to JAMES MORISON, ESQ., the founder of Hygeianism. Monuments to medical men are rarities in the world; not that there have not been great and good men in the profession, but because the want of sound medical principles, and success in curing, (facts universally known,) have always prevented the growth of deep public interest in the minds of the people, in reference to either the conflicting principles or practice of doctors. It is indeed wise that no such monuments should be erected. Such honours appropriately belong to those only, who have done substantial and extensive good in the world. Now the highest medical authorities have themselves admitted <hi
rend="italics">&ldquo;That it is questionable whether their system has not done more real harm than good to the world.&rdquo;</hi> Therefore, to such a profession, monuments are not due. How different is the case with James Morison! His principles, and theory of disease are not conflicting, but accordant; and like all principles of everlasting truth, capable from their simplicity, of being easily understood by the common mind. For us to have been made, by his writings, to understand the general origin of disease, is an attainment unspeakably gratifying, and of unspeakable importance. In what a state of distraction have thousands of us been kept, when trouble was on ourselves, or in our families, because we could neither tell nor understand the causes of that trouble; and of course, had no principles to suggest a natural, and proper method of cure. Such a state of ignorance and uncertainty as this is extremely distressing in a sick family. Enlightened by Hygeian principles, no such uncertainty exists now, with its consequent pain and distraction.
<pb id="p2b" n="2"/>This great blessing we owe to Mr. Morison on our own account, independently of the fact that the same blessing will extend itself to all future ages. A positive discovery in any department of science is a discovery for ever; and honest history will never lose sight of him who made it; but rather surround his name and memory with those praises and laurels that to him justly belong. But what was the discovery? Was it a high road to wealth, to improvements in commerce, or the arts, or anything connected with the dry business concerns of life? No. It was a discovery that pointed directly and certainly to the cause of bodily pain and sickness; and clearly indicated the way to remove them. This was a discovery infinitely surpassing in value to humanity, all the ordinary routine of discoveries with which the world abounds, for what is the worth of life or riches to a sick man, whose days are spent in grief and sorrow? On these grounds a monument to the memory of Morison is pre-eminently due, as a token of gratitude on our part, and as manifesting the sincerity of our convictions. The knowledge that has been so great a blessing to ourselves we desire all men to enjoy; and as a means of extending it, the erection of a permanent monument will be most serviceable. To popularise the sciences is now, by all enlightened minds, regarded as a duty due to society at large. It is quite foreign to the benign, the universal spirit of science, or any truth of nature, to be imprisoned within narrow confines, or to be monopolised by corporated bodies. Science is designed for the blessing and benefit of every human being. Morison was the first individual in Great Britain, perhaps in the civilised world, who made a gigantic and most successful effort to popularise medicine, the prince of all sciences. He has emancipated countless thousands from the chains of professional intolerance and bigotry, elevating their minds to the high, the dignified, the manly position of thinking and acting for themselves, on all subjects connected with their physical well-being. Society now proudly flutters in the breeze, its flag of long won religious and political freedom; and the noble efforts and influence of Morison, will yet result in another victory for oppressed man&mdash;the medical liberty of the subject. Other assistants in this cause have of late years sprung up; but to Morison we are indebted for its bold origination, and the great advancement it has made in these nations. Even on this account, he deserves a monument, as the great originator of medical freedom.</p>
<p>He raised his indignant, powerful voice against the use of poisons as medicine. He pointed out their unmedicinal nature, influence, and fatal effects. He has put thousands on their guard against their use; and thereby saved hosts of lives. His writings on this subject have originated deep and extensive enquiry, on the vastly important subject of the use of poisons for the alleged cure of disease. His opinions and predictions have been verified in the countless numbers of deaths occasioned by their use from his days to the present, death continually increasing in number, in a great variety of horrifying forms&mdash;often occasioned by Doctors, often when the poisons are given by mistake, and often when used by confectioners, grocers, spirit and beer-sellers, by private individuals to kill secretly for the sake of gain, or the gratification of malice; and by professional burglars to secure in quietude the gains they covet, whilst the melancholy fact is&mdash;the doctors have led and taught the way to these murderous, universal practices. At this moment every newspaper teems with the most awful accounts of murders perpetrated by the use of poisons; and Medical hospitals and books, unblushingly proclaim that hosts of patients are daily falling victims to the use of poisons administered as medicines, on the pretence of curing disease. Against these horrifying practices, vastly extended of late years, Morison protested; and taught, that as poisons, they could do nothing but destroy and kill. His protest and his opinions on this subject are not now those of a single individual. He has roused opposition to this direful practice throughout the world, an opposition which now exists as a great moral and medical fact. Some years ago, 19,950 persons in Great Britain, through the instrumentality of the British College of Health, signed a petition to the legislature, to restrain the use and sale of these poisons; and this public sentiment chiefly owed its origin to the writings of Morison, and his successors. And can there be a doubt that, on this ground alone, we would do honour to ourselves, independently of meritorious honour to him, by the erection of the proposed monument?</p>
<p>Who was the first to denounce the use of alcoholic poisons in disease? It was Morison. The simplicity, clearness, consistency, unity, and harmony of his principles, enabled him to see that, in opposing poison as destructive to the tender sensibilities and substance of the bodily structure, alcohol as a certain poison would act in the very same manner; and hence his opposition to it as well as to every other substance of a poisonous nature. Independent of the destructive effects of poisons on the body, he knew that disease simply required the purification and nourishment of that body; and that as alcohol neither purifies nor nourishes, it could never be a fitting medicine. The enunciation of this great saving principle by Morison, led his followers very generally to the adoption of a temperate and abstinent policy, in reference to the common use of all intoxicating drinks, on the ground that if poisons be injurious in disease, they cannot be innocuous in health; or <hi
rend="italics">vice versa,</hi> if they be injurious in health, they cannot be beneficial in disease. To the discussion and adoption of these opinions generally, the most of us, I believe, have been led by what Morison taught respecting them, in his works. In discussing the question of moral evil, we do not condemn one form of it, and uphold others; so Morison in discussing the evils of poison, consistently put his veto on the whole class. I submit, therefore, that his opening up the way to a great medical and moral reformation, in regard to intoxicating drink, forms another important inducement for erecting a monument to his memory and worth.</p>
<p>It was Morison, also, who wrote against the practice of bleeding, described by some medical men themselves, to have been, and to be still, as fatal to society, as the murderous art of war. He knew the blood was the life, the mainspring of the body's support, and, therefore, of its health; and that to abstract blood, was just to abstract life, leave the body weaker, and bring it nearer to death, without purifying, to the slightest extent, the quantity of the vital fluid remaining in the system. Abstracting blood, in the light of these views, and in the light of its known practical effects, justly appeared to him quite inapplicable to the cure of disease, very destructive to the body, and its practice most unphilosophic, unnatural, revolting, and barbarous. Morison has taught us that, the pain which bleeding occasionally (not always) removes, is no evidence of cure, but rather of diminished sensibility, depressed or reduced vitality, occasioned by abstracting that blood, which alone gives sensibility and vitality to
<pb n="3" id="p3b"/>every part of the system. We know pain can always be relieved by taking away a sufficiency of blood; but doing this is at the risk of relieving us of life, of breaking down the bodily vigour; and making recovery quite impossible. He knew pain was only an <hi
rend="italics">effect</hi> of disease, of some irritating waste matter in the body or blood that should not be there; and therefore, like a true philosopher, he said, &ldquo;Let the blood alone, but purge away these irritating matters, and the pain would cease.&rdquo; Now this is a magnificent and true doctrine, which he was the instrument of teaching and extending a thousand times more than any other writer, in opposition to this bloody practice. The result is, that as countless multitudes have adopted his views, a vast amount of life has been prolonged and saved among them by their not having had recourse in any case, to the practice in question. We have increasing reason, then, I aver, to make a grateful and vigorous exertion to raise a monument to a gentleman, who has, in this respect, done us such invaluable service; and brought the medical lancet into such extensive disrepute and disuse.</p>
<p>In addition to all these remarkable and invaluable grounds of public respect, and just claims on our support to the present proposal, I have to add his discovery of an aperient vegetable medicine, most singularly and amazingly adapted to the exigencies of disease. It is on the broad, practical, and curative effects of his medicine, realised in every clime and country, his theories triumphantly stand. It is easy to say purify the blood, and you will enjoy health; but it is not so easy to discover the means of making it pure. And though I were hypothetically to say the means are transcendently simple, yet as centuries have passed without possessing such knowledge, so might pass away centuries to come equally ignorant, had not the unseen agencies and influencies that lie beneath the surface of every-day events interposed, and made in and through James Morison the invaluable discovery of his Universal Vegetable Medicine. You all know it can be used as to quantity, and as to long continuance, with extraordinary safety; and with curative effects, resulting in all kinds of diseases, utterly unknown to the common schools of medicine. Myriads of witnesses can testify to these facts. Of course I am not speaking of a few random, and, therefore, it might be mistaken experiments&mdash;I am speaking as you would of the crowding stars&mdash;speaking of experiments extending over thirty years, throughout all the countries in the civilized world, and in cases almost above human practical reckoning&mdash;so numerous and so common-place, as long, long ago, to have ceased to excite any special interest in the minds of those of us familiarised to such results. No wider field has ever been occupied, or more extensive system of experiments has ever hitherto been made with any one medicine throughout the whole world. The medicine is not propounded on a mysterious principle, to mystify and deceive,&mdash;it is just given as an aperient to cleanse and purge, on the ground that disease needs no other treatment. The medicine once taken, the greatest earthly fool can tell if his disease be either reduced or removed. If the medicine had been propounded on a fraudulent principle, never could any system have been invented so ill calculated to perpetuate the fraud. When purgation is once effected on the principles of the system, the patient has nothing farther to do than to ask &ldquo;am I getting better?&rdquo; His own sensations and condition will always supply an undeceiving answer. This system is neither empirical nor quackish. Nothing can be more distant from its nature then a system of blind experimentation. It is but one medicine&mdash;it is always the same. It is just a transcendently safe, yet when necessary a most powerful aperient. Disease is always the same&mdash;simply morbid matter to remove from the body. The patient is so told; and he soon perceives, to his astonishment, the truth of the theory in the operation of the medicine, and in its beneficial effects on his system. Now, this is not empiricism. It is sound, enlightened, philosophical practice. No higher and surer method of practice, so far as its principle is concerned, exists in the world. The theory of disease, all may comprehend&mdash;all in using the medicine are encouraged to study it. The theory is submitted to the test of the medicine; and the result is, the medicine in its effects and results, proves the theory. This then is not empiricism, with its blind experiments. It is not quackery. Its principles are patent to the world, and beautiful they are, and I may add, not capable of successful refutation. The practice is unsurpassed in simplicity; as well as in its manifest adaption to the theory. On its results the whole truth of the system has been everywhere, and in all times fearlessly, openly, experimentally, perilled; and the world and the profession challenged to come and to behold, to believe or to confute. Had fatal results been consequent on the use of the medicine, then owing to that use being so extensive and unprecedentedly great, these results would have become so public, and in hosts of cases so apparent, and so incapable of concealment, as to have produced universal horror and alarm in the public mind. But no such results have ever taken place. Indeed, the more the medicine is taken and known, the less fear is entertained of injurious consequences. Now it is to Morison we owe the discovery of this practice, and this medicine. It matters not to my objects, though we should be told that, hundreds of other similar medicines now exist in the world. It is simple matter of fact that, Morison was for all practical known purposes, both the originator of his own principles and his own medicine; and though his imitators and rivals, may filch and rob him of his laurels, in ways most dishonourable, he yet had occupied alone a universal field, and acquired universal fame, long before one of them sprang up, indeed, so much so, that the Lancet, the great literary gun of the profession, declared if Morison were not put down, the doctors would be ruined. He then, on these various, all-important grounds, richly deserves at our hands some tribute to his memory; and what way more striking, effective, and public, could we adopt than in erecting the proposed monument?</p>
<p>The vast amount of human life he has been instrumental in saving, is far beyond our calculation. Millions have used his medicine in disease;&mdash;some to a trifling extent only, who, therefore, have derived little or no good&mdash;and some, again, to a fuller extent, thereby obtaining a mitigation of their ailments, whilst others using it more extensively and perseveringly have been rejoicingly cured. Now, had these same millions, not been led to adopt this wonderfully safe, alleviating, curative practice, they would of course, have fallen into the hands of the doctors, who with their astringents, opiates, blisters, bleedings, poisons, alteratives, caustics, knives, lancets, blind experiments, or sheer empiricism, would have, out of that vast number, a mighty multitude to bear evidence of ruined constitutions, shortened lives, and countless deaths, occasioned by having been subjected to the horrible influences of the ill-fated &ldquo;destructive art of healing.&rdquo; These are facts in which we all believe.
<pb id="p4b" n="4"/>They have ever and anon stared us in the face; and though we do not believe Morison's medicine can make us immortal, we know what a vast and safe control it has over common ailments, thus permitting life to run its appointed, natural course, without being cut short by the suicidal hands of the common system of medicine. Admitting then, as we all do, that Morison has been the honoured instrument of saving thousands of lives, without perilling any, who, in this country of great inventions, and saving institutions, could more deserve a monument to perpetuate the memory of his deeds and discoveries?</p>
<p>Well, Morison, after being ripe with years wonderfully extended by his own medicine, gave practical testimony to the truth of his own system on his bed of death; and though now silent among the honoured dead, yet his system lives a blessing to the world at large. His sons possess the spirit, the principles, and the convictions of their departed Sire. They following his footsteps, maintain unflinchingly the Hygeian doctrines, and the British College of Health established by him. They maintain them, as the most of us well know, from incomparably higher motives than the mere love of gain. How often have they fought the battle of right against vindictive medical opposition at enormous expense! How perseveringly have they clung to the noble, the good, and the true cause! How indefatigable in their exertions to enlighten the public mind by publications without number; and to diffuse a knowledge of sound physiological principles irrespective of the sale of their medicine! How unceasingly have they exposed the system of medical poisoning; and made their warning voice reach, by their publications, to the very ends of the earth! How honestly, and how honourably, have they conducted the whole medical business of the College! Who has ever been able to convict them of fraud, or deceit, in all their public efforts and statements in reference to the practical operations of the Hygeian system of medicine? To encourage such noble and invaluable efforts, made by the sons of the great departed dead involving as they do, the good of the world&mdash;efforts made against the most powerful and extensive opposition, and against surrounding ignorance and prejudice in every disagreeable shape and form&mdash;I appeal but to the common sense of you all, if the erection of a monument, even in reference only to them and the cause they now uphold, be not worthy of our most ardent support. It is a most happy idea, to have the monument erected in front of the College, in the centre of the ornamental ground attached to the establishment. The effect will be most imposing and commanding. Fronting, and close to the great London thoroughfare, the New Road, it will daily command the attention of thousands from all parts of the world who throng that road; and lead to enquiries as to whom it represents, by whom it was erected, the cause it comemorates, and the nature of the principles connected with the name of Morison.</p>
<p>The monumental erection will thus become a most important, influential, and extensive teacher. It will be the first grand exhibition in Britain of a monument erected to a great, independent Medical Reformer. It will give telling evidence of mental expansion, elevation, and freedom of thought on the part of thousands in these countries, who have adopted the principles and the practice of Morison. It will prove they are honest in their convictions, for otherwise no such erection could ever have taken place. It will be a standing reproof to doctors, of the inefficiency, danger, and falsities of the greater part of their system. It will confer respect, dignity, and honour on the Hygeian cause; and be a ground of encouragement, and honourable pride to its followers. It will demonstrate that Hygeianism is an established fact in Great Britain; and on all these accounts, it will indeed be a noble <sic
corr="triumph">trimmph</sic>, to see a monument erected to the memory of the world's benefactor; and to the consecration of principles that have saved, and will yet continue to save countless, numbers of lives; control and subdue pain and suffering to a boundless extent; and restore to health, in the future as in the past, inconceivable multitudes who would otherwise have become the victims of disease, and of destructive treatment.</p>

<head>THE WAR.</head>
<p>OUR present poet laureate, Alfred Tennyson, a year or two ago surprised and vexed many peace-loving readers by his advocacy or defence of war, just as his predecessor, William Wordsworth, had done by his sonnets in favour of the punishment of death and his <sic
corr="description">decription</sic> of &ldquo;Slaughter&rdquo; as &ldquo;God's daughter.&rdquo; But, to use the language of Cowper,</p>
<p>&ldquo;War is a game which, were their subjects wise,</p>
<p>Kings would not play at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And certainly the British people, as they have advanced in general intelligence, have set a higher value on human life, and have exhibited an increasing horror of all unnecessary bloodshed. The poorer classes have found that even remote foreign wars have a tendency to raise the price of the necessaries of life at home. We are glad to learn that with respect to articles of apparel and all items included in the term &ldquo;outfit,&rdquo; the great merchant tailors in the Minories, E. MOSES and SON, are prepared&mdash;having extraordinary facilities for the purpose&mdash;to accommodate their extensive circle of customers of all ranks as economically in the calamitous days of warfare as when Peace and Commerce walk hand in hand together.</p>
