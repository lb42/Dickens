<head>MESSRS. SOUTHGATE AND BARRETT</head>
<p>HAVE RECEIVED INSTRUCTIONS <lb/> TO SELL BY PUBLIC AUCTION <lb/> AT THEIR ROOMS IN FLEET STREET, <lb/> IN THE MONTH OF DECEMBER, <lb/> THE WHOLE OF THE REMAINING IMPRESSIONS OF THE WORK KNOWN AS <lb/> &ldquo;ROBERTS'S HOLY LAND.&rdquo; </p>
<p>EGYPT, NUBIA, SYRIA, IDUMEA, ARABIA.</p>
<p>Complete in Forty Parts, large folio, published at Forty Guineas, and never reduced in price.</p>
<p>THE Drawings were in all instances made on the spot by DAVID ROBERTS, R.A.; and they have all been executed in Lithography by LOUIS HAGHE. They are accompanied by Historical and Descriptive Letter-press, written by the Rev. Dr. CROLY and W. BROCKEDON, Esq. And, in its completed state, it is not too much to say, that a more perfect work has never been published in any country. Apart from its importance and value as a production of Art, it describes the most interesting countries of the World; interesting, not alone because of the History, but from their intimate association with the events and characters of Holy Writ.</p>
<p>They deem it their duty to claim the attention of all classes,&mdash;the Artist, the Connoisseur, the Lover of Art, the Man of Letters, and especially the Clergy,&mdash;to this justly-renowned publication, of which it is not too much to say that no production of more extended interest, or of higher value, has been ever issued in this country, or, perhaps, in any country of the world.</p>
<p>They also announce that the comparatively few copies about to be submitted to public competition will be the last that can be issued,&mdash;inasmuch <hi rend="italics">as the stones from which the prints have been worked</hi> will be ALL DESTROYED in the Rooms <hi rend="italics">during the progress of the sale,</hi> and in the presence of the attendants: thus affording the only certain evidence that no inferior impressions can ever be circulated, while establishing the rarity and securing the value of those which will then become the property of the purchasers. The opportunity now offered will, then, be the last by which this magnificent work can be procured; and which, therefore, must within a very short time be classed among &ldquo;scarce books,&rdquo;&mdash;to be obtained only at a price very largely advanced upon that for which it may, under present circumstances, be attainable.</p>
<p>Although this publication was, during its issue, strictly confined to &ldquo;subscribers,&rdquo; enough is known of its general character to warrant the assertion that a production which combined so many rare excellences was never issued to the public; and that, although the speculation of a single publisher, it is a work of which the British people may be justly proud, and which may be rightly described as in the best sense of the term, NATIONAL.</p>
<p>Mr. ALDERMAN MOON, whose retirement from business has led to the sale under notice, embarked in the produce of this Work a very large capital&mdash;it was the <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fre">chef-d'oeuvre</foreign></hi> of his establishment; the whole of the arrangements connected with it were conducted with that judicious liberality and pure taste which originated and secured his success. During its progress and on its completion, he received the congratulations of the highest authorities in the realm; and to this publication, above all others, he is indebted for that renown which gives him pre-eminence among Publishers who have fostered and advanced the best interests of British Art.</p>
<p>The Artist, DAVID ROBERTS, R.A., whose fame has resulted mainly from pictures of this peculiar class,&mdash;entered into the work with that deep and earnest love of his &ldquo;great theme&rdquo; which of itself guaranteed surpassing excellence. The subjects were fertile: they embraced every variety:&mdash;sacred structures which had endured for centuries&mdash;near and distant views of cities&mdash;picturesque ruins&mdash;grand and beautiful seaports&mdash;fountains and rivers&mdash;wild mountains and fertile valleys:&mdash;in short, it was impossible in any region to obtain a series of topics for the pencil more fruitful of interest, more beautiful, or more suggestive.</p>
<p>But these advantages of beauty and variety are very largely enhanced by the &ldquo;Histories&rdquo; with which these scenes are for ever associated: not a spot, nor a ruin, nor a hill, nor a valley, nor a river, scarcely a stream or even a stone, which is not familiar to every reader of Holy Writ. The theme was inspiring: the accomplished Artist, who is famous wherever the high and pure in Art are appreciated, considered the task he had undertaken as a &ldquo;labour of love;&rdquo; and to him, as to the publisher, the Work will be an honourable and enduring monument.</p>
<p>It was of especial importance that the duty of multiplying the productions of the Painter should be confided to worthy hands; it could have been discharged by no living Artist so efficiently as by M. LOUIS HAGHE. to whom this division of the task was intrusted. As it is beyond question his greatest, so it may be regarded as the latest, work he will produce; for it is known that, for some time, he has abandoned the labours of the copyist for that of the originator, the productions of his pencil now procuring for him a larger recompense and a more extended fame.</p>
<p>Considered merely as examples of Lithography, these Prints are of excellence unsurpassed in Europe.</p>
<p>It will be at once understood, that to no writer could the Letterpress have been confided with greater propriety than to the Rev. Dr. CROLY, the able Annotator on the &ldquo;Revelations,&rdquo; the eloquent Author of &ldquo;Salathiel:&rdquo; thoroughly conversant with the subject, familiar with every incident connected with the sacred theme, his descriptions are at once poetical and accurate,&mdash;models of vigorous and graceful composition.</p>
<p>We repeat, therefore, that a Work which combines so many excellences of Artists and Authors, which embraces subjects of such universal interest, and which is in all respects so perfect in every department (not the least of which concerns the manner in which the task of the Printer has been performed), has never been surpassed in any age or country.</p>
<p>The Descriptive List, which may be obtained at 22, Fleet-street, contains the names of the 249 Prints of which the Work consists: the Holy Land. Syria Idumea, Arabia, Egypt, and Nubia! Following in the footsteps of our Lord, or in those of his Disciples, every spot treated by the Artist is consecrated ground,&mdash;hallowed by associations so deeply interesting as very largely, indeed, to enhance the value of these views, beautiful as they are, considered merely as works of Art. The series is a rich and full volume of enjoyment and instruction, teaching while giving pleasure, and aiding to confirm that <hi rend="italics">faith</hi> which is the surest basis of human happiness.</p>
<p>MESSRS. SOUTHGATE AND BARRETT, in announcing this sale, therefore, feel the occasion to be one of no common importance, and claim for it the attention of all the numerous classes whom it undoubtedly concerns.</p>
<p>Noblemen and Gentlemen who cannot attend the sale may have their Commissions faithfully executed by Messrs. Southgate and Barrett, free of charge.</p>

<p>BRADBURY &amp; EVANS, 11, BOUVERIE STREET.</p>
<div3 type="section">
<head>OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.</head>
<p>&ldquo;Among serials, the most important in our eyes is the new edition of the <hi rend="italics">Penny Cyclopoedia</hi> issued in separate divisions under the name of the <hi rend="italics">English Cyclopoedia.</hi>&rdquo;&mdash;<hi rend="italics">Leader.</hi></p>
<p>&ldquo;We do not feel that it is employing the language of exaggeration to say that the issue in a cheap and greatly improved form of the <hi rend="italics">English Cyclopoedia,</hi> under the editorship of Mr. CHARLES KNIGHT, and with the co-operation of Messrs. BRADBURY &amp; EVANS, dedicated by permission to Her Majesty, partakes of the character of a national undertaking.&rdquo;&mdash;<hi rend="italics">Weekly News and Chronicle.</hi></p>
<p>&ldquo;The mass of information here presented in a beautiful type and a readable form, the cleverness and value of the illustrations, and the extraordinary cheapness of the whole, combine, with the publication-advantages we have explained, to render the <hi rend="italics">English Cyclopoedia</hi> the best thing of its class, and one which we can conscientiously recommend to our readers.&rdquo;&mdash;<hi rend="italics">The Field.</hi></p>
<p>&ldquo;This invaluable work has now reached the twelfth number; and the public have been afforded ample opportunity of testing its merits as one of the most copious and complete Cyclop&aelig;dias, and certainly the cheapest that has ever been issued.&rdquo;&mdash;<hi rend="italics">Dublin Evening Post</hi></p>
<p>&ldquo;The <hi rend="italics">English</hi> cyclopedia, Part II., is occupied with Natural History and Geography. The effect of skilful printing is here more than ever apparent. Dr. LANKESTER has undertaken to bring the botanical articles up to the present state of knowledge.&rdquo;&mdash;<hi rend="italics">Gardener's Chronicle.</hi></p>
<p>&ldquo;Three parts are now before us; and, while they show perfection in typography, they evince the utmost fulness of knowledge in the writers&mdash;discoveries and details being brought down to the present day. The <hi rend="italics">Penny Cyclopoedia</hi> was undoubtedly the best general dictionary ever published; but we can say that this one promises to be still better.&rdquo;&mdash;<hi rend="italics">Liverpool Journal.</hi></p>
<p>&ldquo;Of the First Part we have at present to speak, and from the specimen before us, we most conscientiously and emphatically recommend these ample dictionaries upon special subjects of almost universal interest, as by far the best that are likely to be procurable for many years, equally full&mdash;and published for a price which, at the present cost of production, after allowing for a most extensive sale, can be taken strictly as the <hi rend="italics">minimum</hi> of cheapness possible in our day.&rdquo;&mdash;<hi rend="italics">Examiner.</hi></p>
<p>&ldquo;The first six numbers of this publication are now before us, and if they are to be taken as a sample of the remaining numbers, it may truly be described as a wonderful production in a variety of ways; accuracy, the beauty and correctness of the wood engravings, in the Natural History portion; and though last not least its amazing cheapness.&rdquo;&mdash;<hi rend="italics">Dumfries Courier.</hi></p>

<p>THE HOME COMPANION: <lb/> A Weekly Magazine of the Useful, Instructive, and Amusing.</p>
<p>MESSRS. WILLIAM S. ORR &amp; Co. respectfully intimate, that the HOME COMPANION is now issued from their Establishment.</p>
<p>The HOME COMPANION addresses itself, in the widest sense, to the Home sympathies, as well as to the literary tastes of the British public.</p>
<p>In Literature it aims at being original, diversified, and instructive, vigorous and humorous, and, avoiding coarseness or indelicacy, may with safety be adopted for family reading.</p>
<p>It is proposed occasionally to discuss such topics as at the moment excite general attention; to treat them historically, and to place the entire subject before the reader. Where engravings can be introduced with advantage, such subjects will be copiously illustrated.</p>
<p>The Illustrations will be prepared with the greatest care, under the direction of a well-known Artist.</p>
<p>To the Trade the Publishers appeal confidently for assistance in making the work extensively known, and feeling assured that their past intercourse with their brethren, and the merits of the work itself, will fully justify the support.</p>

<head>THE DECLINE OF LIFE.</head>
<p>FREDERICK THE GREAT thought it disobedience in his grenadiers to wish to live for ever: the grenadiers themselves had a decided objection to die prematurely. There is something terrible in death: the old, the young, the rich, the poor, seek to avoid it, but few take the proper means of prolonging life. You cannot live for ever, but you may live a long&mdash;a very long&mdash;time, if labelled as glass cases on railways are, &ldquo;with care.&rdquo; If you wish to get at the secret, you must read that most valuable work, the &ldquo;Life and Times of Old Thomas Parr,&rdquo; and follow out his wise instructions on the all-important subject, &ldquo;Health and the means of Prolonging Life.&rdquo; This interesting little &ldquo;Life and Times&rdquo; may be had through the Post by sending two Penny Stamps, addressed to T.

<p>THE ADVANTAGES TO BE DERIVED FROM TAKING <lb/> PARR'S LIFE PILLS <lb/> ARE</p>
<list>
<item>1st.&mdash;SOUND AND REFRESHING SLEEP.</item>
<item>2nd.&mdash;GOOD APPETITE.</item>
<item>3rd.&mdash;ENERGY OF MIND AND CLEARNESS OF PERCEPTION.</item>
<item>4th.&mdash;GENERAL GOOD HEALTH AND COMFORT.</item>
<item>5th.&mdash;THEY ARE FOUND, AFTER GIVING THEM A FAIR TRIAL FOR A FEW WEEKS, TO POSSESS THE MOST ASTONISHING AND INVIGORATING PROPERTIES.</item>
</list></div3>
<div3><head>TO LADIES.</head>
<p>PARR'S LIFE PILLS are especially efficacious in all the variety of ailments incidental to the Fair Sex. Ladies even of the most delicate constitutions will find them particularly beneficial both before and after confinement; and for general use in SCHOOLS they cannot be two strongly recommended. They mildly and speedily remove all Skin Eruptions, Sallowness of complexion, Nervous Irritability, Sick Head-ache, Depression of Spirits, Irregularity, or General Derangement of the System.</p></div3>
<div3>
<head>TO PERSONS GOING ABROAD.</head>
<p>PARR'S LIFE PILLS are particularly recommended to all persons going abroad and subjecting themselves to great change of climate. OFFICERS OF THE ARMY AND NAVY, MISSIONARIES, EMIGRANTS, &amp;c., will find them an invaluable appendage to their medicine chests as a preventive of the attacks of those prevalent diseases so fatal in our colonies; and in all affections and disorders especially incident to the tropics, they will be found invaluable. It is the best medicine ever used in Scurvy, and every variety of Scorbutic affections, making it very desirable to TAKE TO SEA. It is eagerly sought after in all our colonies, especially in the West Indies, where a small box recently sold for 10s. In America, Australia, India, and China, also, its fame is known and its virtues duly appreciated, causing an immense demand for it; and there is no country or port in the world where it will not speedily become an article of extensive traffic, profit, and general utility, as it may be had recourse to in all cases of sickness, with confidence in its simplicity and in its power to produce relief.</p></div3><div3>
<p>Mr. WILLIAM WYLD, South-street, Manchester, hereby publicly states, that after being out of health for many years, although he had used every means recommended to him without success, chanced to hear of PARR'S PILLS, which have done him more good in a few weeks than all the physic he has taken for years. He earnestly recommends them to the sick and afflicted, having proved their infinite value.</p>
<p>Mr. JOHN HOLLINGSWORTH, Grocer, Church Greesly, Derbyshire, has been for a long time afflicted with giddiness in the head and shortness of breath, and could get no rest night or day; he had taken professional advice and much medicine of various kinds, but to no effect; at length he was advised to try PARR'S LIFE PILLS, and purchased a box, and the <hi rend="italics">very first night</hi> he found sound and refreshing sleep. He has used three boxes and is now quite well. He is determined never to be without them in the house.</p>

It is no misnomer cordial I&mdash;no stupefactive, deadly narcotic I&mdash;but a veritable preserver of infants! Mothers would do well in always keeping it in the nursery. Many thousands of children are annually saved by this much-esteemed medicine, which is an immediate remedy, and the infants rather like it than otherwise.</p>

<head>TEAS OF THE BEST QUALITIES.</head>
<p>NOW that the effect of the Reduction of the Tea duties is manifest in the general reduction to Consumers of the prices of all Teas, purchasers naturally look around for an Establishment where they can obtain goods of the best qualities, and at the most moderate prices.</p>
<p>With the contradictory statements as to the prices of the best Teas, that day by day meet the public eye, it is no doubt comparatively a difficult task to detect the true from the false statement, to discover whether the assertions put forward can possibly be carried out, or whether, on their face, they do not bear an appearance of deception. For instance, if a trader offer to supply the best Congou Tea at 3s. 4d. per 1b., while as is well known by people connected with the markets, the best Congou Tea, Duty paid, cannot now be purchased by the trader under 3s. 11d., or thereabouts, it must be evident either that such statement is untrue, or that the trader loses considerably by his business; the latter presumption not generally credited.</p>
<p>It has always been our effort to supply, at the most moderate prices, Teas and Coffees of the best qualities obtainable, to character them in such a manner that no purchaser may be disappointed, and to represent, as clearly as possible, the merits and demerits of each article submitted for sale. By this plan we have gained the recommendations of our friends, and have, at the same time, succeeded in supplying the purchaser with the particular article that he desired.</p>
<p>In consequence of the present reduction of the Duty, though the market value of Tea has advanced, we are enabled to supply Teas of the finest qualities, and at prices</p>
<div3 type="section">
<head>CHEAPER THAN EVER.</head>
<p>We select for quotation the following class of Articles, being those in most genera consumption. Judging from their published details, we should presume that few traders supply Teas and coffees of finer qualities.</p>

<head>CHAPTER LX. <lb/> PERSPECTIVE.</head>
<p>I PROCEED to other passages of my narrative. From the goodness of all about me, I derived such consolation as I can never think of unmoved. I have already said so much of myself, and so much still remains, that I will not dwell upon my sorrow. I had an illness, but it was not a long one; and I would avoid even this mention of it, if I could quite keep down the recollection of their sympathy.</p>
<p>I proceed to other passages of my narrative.</p>
<p>During the time of my illness, we were still in London, where Mrs. Woodcourt had come, on my guardian's invitation, to stay with us. When my guardian thought me well and cheerful enough to talk with him in our old way&mdash;though I could have done that sooner, if he would have believed me&mdash;I resumed my work, and my chair beside his. He had appointed the time himself, and we were alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dame Trot,&rdquo; said he, receiving me with a kiss, &ldquo;welcome to the Growlery again, my dear. I have a scheme to develope, little woman. I purpose to remain here, perhaps for six months, perhaps for a longer time&mdash;as it may be. Quite to settle here for a while, in short.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in the meanwhile leave Bleak House?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, my dear! Bleak House,&rdquo; he returned, &ldquo;must learn to take care of itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought his tone sounded sorrowful; but, looking at him, I saw his kind face lighted up by its pleasantest smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bleak House,&rdquo; he repeated; and his tone did <hi rend="italics">not</hi> sound sorrowful, I found, &ldquo;must learn to take care of itself. It is a long way from Ada, my dear, and Ada stands much in need of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is like you, guardian,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;to have been taking that into consideration, for a happy surprise to both of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so disinterested either, my dear, if you mean to extol me for that virtue; since, if you were generally on the road, you could be seldom with me. And besides; I wish to hear as much and as often of Ada as I can, in this condition of estrangement from poor Rick. Not of her alone, but of him too, poor fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen Mr. Woodcourt, this morning, guardian?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see Mr. Woodcourt every morning, Dame Durden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he still say the same of Richard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the same. He knows of no direct bodily illness that he has; on the contrary, he believes that he has none. Yet he is not easy about him; who <hi rend="italics">can</hi> be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My dear girl had been to see us lately, every day: sometimes twice in a day. But we had foreseen, all along, that this would only last until I was quite myself. We knew full well that her fervent heart was as full of affection and gratitude towards her cousin John as it had ever been, and we acquitted Richard of laying any injunctions upon her to stay
<pb n="578" id="p578"/>
away; but we knew on the other hand that she felt it a part of her duty to him, to be sparing of her visits at our house. My guardian's delicacy had soon perceived this, and had tried to convey to her that he thought she was right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, unfortunate, mistaken Richard,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;When will he awake from his delusion!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not in the way to do so now, my dear,&rdquo; replied my guardian. &ldquo;The more he suffers, the more averse he will be to me: having made me the principal representative of the great occasion of his suffering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could not help adding, &ldquo;So unreasonably!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Dame Trot, Dame Trot!&rdquo; returned my guardian, &ldquo;what shall we find reasonable in Jarndyce and Jarndyce! Unreason and injustice at the top, unreason and injustice at the heart and at the bottom, unreason and injustice from beginning to end&mdash;if it ever has an end&mdash;how should poor Rick, always hovering near it, pluck reason out of it? He no more gathers grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles, than older men did, in old times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His gentleness and consideration for Richard, whenever we spoke of him, touched me so, that I was always silent on this subject very soon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose the Lord Chancellor, and the Vice Chancellors, and the whole Chancery battery of great guns, would be infinitely astonished by such unreason and injustice in one of their suitors,&rdquo; pursued my guardian. &ldquo;When those learned gentlemen begin to raise moss-roses from the powder they sow in their wigs, I shall begin to be astonished too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He checked himself in glancing towards the window to look where the wind was, and leaned on the back of my chair instead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, little woman! To go on, my dear. This rock we must leave to time, chance, and hopeful circumstance. We must not shipwreck Ada upon it. She cannot afford, and he cannot afford, the remotest chance of another separation from a friend. Therefore, I have particularly begged of Woodcourt, and I now particularly beg of you, my dear, not to move this subject with Rick. Let it rest. Next week, next month, next year, sooner or later, he will see me with clearer eyes. I can wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I had already discussed it with him, I confessed; and so, I thought, had Mr. Woodcourt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he tells me,&rdquo; returned my guardian. &ldquo;Very good. He has made his protest, and Dame Durden has made hers, and there is nothing more to be said about it. Now, I come to Mrs. Woodcourt. How do you like her, my dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In answer to this question, which was oddly abrupt, I said I liked her very much, and thought she was more agreeable than she used to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so too,&rdquo; said my guardian. &ldquo;Less pedigree? Not so much of Morgan-ap&mdash;what's his name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was what I meant, I acknowledged; though he was a very harmless person, even when we had more of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still, upon the whole, he is as well in his native mountains,&rdquo; said my guardian. &ldquo;I agree with you. Then, little woman, can I do better for a time than retain Mrs. Woodcourt here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No. And yet&mdash;</p>
<pb n="579" id="p579"/>
<p>My guardian looked at me, waiting for what I had to say.</p>
<p>I had nothing to say. At least I had nothing in my mind that I could say. I had an undefined impression that it might have been better if we had had some other inmate, but I could hardly have explained why, even to myself. Or, if to myself, certainly not to anybody else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said my guardian, &ldquo;our neighbourhood is in Woodcourt's way, and he can come here to see her as often as he likes, which is agreeable to them both; and she is familiar to us, and fond of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes. That was undeniable. I had nothing to say against it. I could not have suggested a better arrangement; but I was not quite easy in my mind. Esther, Esther, why not? Esther, think!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a very good plan indeed, dear guardian, and we could not do better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, little woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quite sure. I had had a moment's time to think, since I had urged that duty on myself, and I was quite sure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said my guardian. &ldquo;It shall be done. Carried unanimously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carried unanimously,&rdquo; I repeated, going on with my work.</p>
<p>It was a cover for his book-table that I happened to be ornamenting. It had been laid by on the night preceding my sad journey, and never resumed. I showed it to him now, and he admired it highly. After I had explained the pattern to him, and all the great effects that were to come out by-and-by, I thought I would go back to our last theme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said, dear guardian, when we spoke of Mr. Woodcourt before Ada left us, that you thought he would give a long trial to another country. Have you been advising him since?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, little woman; pretty often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he decided to do so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rather think not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some other prospect has opened to him, perhaps?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;yes&mdash;perhaps,&rdquo; returned my guardian, beginning his answer in a very deliberate manner. &ldquo;About half a year hence or so, there is a medical attendant for the poor to be appointed at a certain place in Yorkshire. It is a thriving place, pleasantly situated; streams and streets, town and country, mill and moor; and seems to present an opening for such a man. I mean, a man whose hopes and aims may sometimes lie (as most men's sometimes do, I dare say) above the ordinary level, but to whom the ordinary level will be high enough after all, if it should prove to be a way of usefulness and good service leading to no other. All generous spirits are ambitious, I suppose; but the ambition that calmly trusts itself to such a road, instead of spasmodically trying to fly over it, is of the kind I care for. It is Woodcourt's kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will he get this appointment?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, little woman,&rdquo; returned my guardian, smiling, &ldquo;not being an oracle, I cannot confidently say; but I think so. His reputation stands very high; there were people from that part of the country in the shipwreck; and, strange to say, I believe the best man has the best chance. You must not suppose it to be a fine endowment. It is a very, very commonplace affair, my dear; an appointment to a great amount of work
<pb n="580" id="p580"/>
and a small amount of pay; but better things will gather about it, it may be fairly hoped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poor of that place will have reason to bless the choice, if it falls on Mr. Woodcourt, guardian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, little woman; that I am sure they will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We said no more about it, nor did he say a word about the future of Bleak House. But it was the first time I had taken my seat at his side in my mourning dress, and that accounted for it I considered.</p>
<p>I now began to visit my dear girl every day, in the dull dark corner where she lived. The morning was my usual time; but whenever I found I had an hour or so to spare, I put on my bonnet and bustled off to Chancery Lane. They were both so glad to see me at all hours, and used to brighten up so when they heard me opening the door and coming in (being quite at home, I never knocked), that I had no fear of becoming troublesome just yet.</p>
<p>On these occasions I frequently found Richard absent. At other times he would be writing, or reading papers in the Cause, at that table of his, so covered with papers, which was never disturbed. Sometimes I would come upon him, lingering at the door of Mr. Vholes's office. Sometimes I would meet him in the neighbourhood, lounging about, and biting his nails. I often met him wandering in Lincoln's Inn, near the place where I had first seen him, O how different, how different!</p>
<p>That the money Ada brought him was melting away with the candles I used to see burning after dark in Mr. Vholes's office, I knew very well. It was not a large amount in the beginning; he had married in debt; and I could not fail to understand, by this time, what was meant by Mr. Vholes's shoulder being at the wheel&mdash;as I still heard it was. My dear made the best of housekeepers, and tried hard to save; but I knew that they were getting poorer and poorer every day.</p>
<p>She shone in the miserable corner like a beautiful star. She adorned and graced it so, that it became another place. Paler than she had been at home, and a little quieter than I had thought natural when she was yet so cheerful and hopeful, her face was so unshadowed, that I half believed she was blinded by her love for Richard to his ruinous career.</p>
<p>I went one day to dine with them, while I was under this impression. As I turned into Symond's Inn, I met little Miss Flite coming out. She had been to make a stately call upon the wards in Jarndyce, as she still called them, and had derived the highest gratification from that ceremony. Ada had already told me that she called every Monday at five o'clock, with one little extra white bow in her bonnet, which never appeared there at any other time, and with her largest reticule of documents on her arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear!&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;So delighted! How do you do! So glad to see you. And you are going to visit our interesting Jarndyce wards? <hi rend="italics">To</hi> be sure! Our beauty is at home, my dear, and will be charmed to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Richard is not come in yet?&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I am glad of that, for I was afraid of being a little late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he is not come in,&rdquo; returned Miss Flite. &ldquo;He has had a long day in court. I left him there, with Vholes. You don't like Vholes, I hope? <hi rend="italics">Don't</hi> like Vholes. Dan-gerous man!&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="581" id="p581"/>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid you see Richard oftener than ever now?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dearest,&rdquo; returned Miss Flite, &ldquo;daily and hourly. You know what I told you of the attraction on the Chancellor's table? My dear, next to myself he is the most constant suitor in court. He begins quite to amuse our little party. Ve-ry friendly little party, are we not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was miserable to hear this from her poor mad lips, though it was no surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In short, my valued friend,&rdquo; pursued Miss Flite, advancing her lips to my ear, with an air of equal patronage and mystery, &ldquo;I must tell you a secret. I have made him my executor. Nominated, constituted, and appointed him. In my will. Ye-es.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye-es,&rdquo; repeated Miss Flite, in her most genteel accents, &ldquo;my executor, administrator, and assign. (Our Chancery phrases, my love.) I have reflected that if I should wear out, he will be able to watch that judgment. Being so very regular in his attendance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It made me sigh to think of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did at one time mean,&rdquo; said Miss Flite, echoing the sigh, &ldquo;to nominate, constitute, and appoint poor Gridley. Also very regular, my charming girl. I assure you, most exemplary! But he wore out, poor man, so I have appointed his successor. Don't mention it. This is in confidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She carefully opened her reticule a little way, and shewed me a folded piece of paper inside, as the appointment of which she spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another secret, my dear. I have added to my collection of birds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, Miss Flite?&rdquo; said I, knowing how it pleased her to have her confidence received with an appearance of interest.</p>
<p>She nodded several times, and her face became overcast and gloomy. &ldquo;Two more. I call them the Wards in Jarndyce. They are caged up with all the others. With Hope, Joy, Youth, Peace, Rest, Life, Dust, Ashes, Waste, Want, Ruin, Despair, Madness, Death, Cunning, Folly, Words, Wigs, Rags, Sheepskin, Plunder, Precedent, Jargon, Gammon, and Spinach!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor soul kissed me, with the most troubled look I had ever seen in her; and went her way. Her manner of running over the names of her birds, as if she were afraid of hearing them even from her own lips, quite chilled me.</p>
<p>This was not a cheering preparation for my visit, and I could have dispensed with the company of Mr. Vholes, when Richard (who arrived within a minute or two after me) brought him to share our dinner. Although it was a very plain one, Ada and Richard were for some minutes both out of the room together, helping to get ready what we were to eat and drink. Mr. Vholes took that opportunity of holding a little conversation in a low voice with me. He came to the window where I was sitting, and began upon Symond's Inn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dull place, Miss Summerson, for a life that is not an official one,&rdquo; said Mr. Vholes, smearing the glass with his black glove to make it clearer for me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is not much to see here,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor to hear, miss,&rdquo; returned Mr. Vholes. &ldquo;A little music does
<pb n="582" id="p582"/>
occasionally stray in; but we are not musical in the law, and soon eject it. I hope Mr. Jarndyce is as well as his friends could wish him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thanked Mr. Vholes, and said he was quite well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not the pleasure to be admitted among the number of his friends myself,&rdquo; said Mr. Vholes, &ldquo;and I am aware that the gentlemen of our profession are sometimes regarded in such quarters with an unfavorable eye. Our plain course, however, under good report and evil report, and all kinds of prejudice, (we are the victims of prejudice) is to have everything openly carried on. How do you find Mr. C looking, Miss Summerson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looks very ill. Dreadfully anxious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said Mr. Vholes.</p>
<p>He stood behind me, with his long black figure reaching nearly to the ceiling of those low rooms; feeling the pimples on his face as if they were ornaments, and speaking inwardly and evenly as though there were not a human passion or emotion in his nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Woodcourt is in attendance upon Mr. C, I believe?&rdquo; he resumed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Woodcourt is his disinterested friend,&rdquo; I answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I mean in professional attendance, medical attendance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That can do little for an unhappy mind,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said Mr. Vholes.</p>
<p>So slow, so eager, so bloodless and gaunt, I felt as if Richard were wasting away beneath the eyes of this adviser, and there were something of the Vampire in him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Summerson,&rdquo; said Mr. Vholes, very slowly rubbing his gloved hands, as if, to his cold sense of touch, they were much the same in black kid or out of it, &ldquo;this was an ill-advised marriage of Mr. C's.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I begged he would excuse me for discussing it. They had been engaged when they were both very young, I told him (a little indignantly), and when the prospect before them was much fairer and brighter. When Richard had not yielded himself to the unhappy influence which now darkened his life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; assented Mr. Vholes again. &ldquo;Still, with a view to everything being openly carried on, I will, with your permission, Miss Summerson, observe to you that I consider this a very ill-advised marriage indeed. I owe the opinion, not only to Mr. C's connexions, against whom I should naturally wish to protect myself, but also to my own reputation&mdash;dear to myself, as a professional man aiming to keep respectable; dear to my three girls at home, for whom I am striving to realise some little independence; dear, I will even say, to my aged father, whom it is my privilege to support.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would become a very different marriage, a much happier and better marriage, another marriage altogether, Mr. Vholes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if Richard were persuaded to turn his back on the fatal pursuit in which you are engaged with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Vholes, with a noiseless cough&mdash;or rather gasp&mdash;into one of his black gloves, inclined his head as if he did not wholly dispute even that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Summerson,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it may be so; and I freely admit that the young lady who has taken Mr. C's name upon herself in so ill-advised
<pb n="583" id="p583"/>
a manner&mdash;you will I am sure not quarrel with me for throwing out that remark again, as a duty I owe to Mr. C's connexions&mdash;is a highly genteel young lady. Business has prevented me from mixing much with general society, in any but a professional character; still I trust I am competent to perceive that she is a highly genteel young lady. As to beauty, I am not a judge of that myself, and I never did give much attention to it from a boy; but I dare say the young lady is equally eligible, in that point of view. She is considered so (I have heard) among the clerks in the Inn, and it is a point more in their way than in mine. In reference to Mr. C's pursuit of his interests&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O! His interests, Mr. Vholes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; returned Mr. Vholes, going on in exactly the same inward and dispassionate manner, &ldquo;Mr. C takes certain interests under certain wills disputed in the suit. It is a term we use. In reference to Mr. C's pursuit of his interests, I mentioned to you, Miss Summerson, the first time I had the pleasure of seeing you, in my desire that everything should be openly carried on&mdash;I used those words, for I happened afterwards to note them in my diary, which is producible at any time&mdash;I mentioned to you that Mr. C had laid down the principle of watching his own interests; and that when a client of mine laid down a principle which was not of an immoral (that is to say, unlawful) nature, it devolved upon me to carry it out. I <hi rend="italics">have</hi> carried it out; I <hi rend="italics">do</hi> carry it out. But I will not smooth things over, to any connexion of Mr. C's, on any account. As open as I was to Mr. Jarndyce, I am to you. I regard it in the light of a professional duty to be so, though it can be charged to no one. I openly say, unpalatable as it may be, that I consider Mr. C's affairs in a very bad way, that I consider Mr. C himself in a very bad way, and that I regard this as an exceedingly ill-advised marriage.&mdash;Am I here, sir? Yes, I thank you; I am here, Mr. C, and enjoying the pleasure of some agreeable conversation with Miss Summerson, for which I have to thank you very much, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off thus, in answer to Richard, who addressed him as he came into the room. By this time, I too well understood Mr. Vholes's scrupulous way of saving himself and his respectability, not to feel that our worst fears did but keep pace with his client's progress.</p>
<p>We sat down to dinner, and I had an opportunity of observing Richard, anxiously. I was not disturbed by Mr. Vholes (who took off his gloves to dine), though he sat opposite to me at the small table; for I doubt if, looking up at all, he once removed his eyes from his host's face. I found Richard thin and languid, slovenly in his dress, abstracted in his manner forcing his spirits now and then, and at other intervals relapsing into a dull thoughtfulness. About his large bright eyes that used to be so merry, there was a wanness and a restlessness that changed them altogether I cannot use the expression that he looked old. There is a ruin of youth which is not like age; and into such a ruin, Richard's youth and youthful beauty had all fallen away.</p>
<p>He ate little, and seemed indifferent what it was; shewed himself to be much more impatient than he used to be; and was quick, even with Ada. I thought, at first, that his old-light-hearted manner was all gone; but it shone out of him sometimes, as I had occasionally known little momentary glimpses of my own old face to look out upon me from the
<pb n="584" id="p584"/>
glass. His laugh had not quite left him either; but it was like the echo of a joyful sound, and that is always sorrowful.</p>
<p>Yet he was as glad as ever, in his old affectionate way, to have me there; and we talked of the old times pleasantly. These did not appear to be interesting to Mr. Vholes, though he occasionally made a gasp which I believe was his smile. He rose shortly after dinner, and said that with the permission of the ladies he would retire to his office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always devoted to business, Vholes!&rdquo; cried Richard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. C,&rdquo; he returned, &ldquo;the interests of clients are never to be neglected, sir. They are paramount in the thoughts of a professional man like myself, who wishes to preserve a good name among his fellow practitioners and society at large. My denying myself the pleasure of the present agreeable conversation, may not be wholly irrespective of your own interests, Mr. C.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard expressed himself quite sure of that, and lighted Mr. Vholes out. On his return he told us, more than once, that Vholes was a good fellow, a safe fellow, a man who did what he pretended to do, a very good fellow, indeed! He was so defiant about it, that it struck me he had begun to doubt Mr. Vholes.</p>
<p>Then he threw himself on the sofa, tired out; and Ada and I put things to rights, for they had no other servant than the woman who attended to the chambers. My dear girl had a cottage piano there, and quietly sat down to sing some of Richard's favorites; the lamp being first removed into the next room, as he complained of its hurting his eyes.</p>
<p>I sat between them, at my dear girl's side, and felt very melancholy listening to her sweet voice. I think Richard did too; I think he darkened the room for that reason. She had been singing some time, rising between-whiles to bend over him and speak to him; when Mr. Woodcourt came in. Then he sat down by Richard; and half playfully, half earnestly, quite naturally and easily, found out how he felt, and where he had been all day. Presently he proposed to accompany him in a short walk on one of the bridges, as it was a moonlight airy night; and Richard readily consenting, they went out together.</p>
<p>They left my dear girl still sitting at the piano, and me still sitting beside her. When they were gone out, I drew my arm round her waist. She put her left hand in mine (I was sitting on that side), but kept her right upon the keys&mdash;going over and over them, without striking any note.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Esther, my dearest,&rdquo; she said, breaking silence, &ldquo;Richard is never so well, and I am never so easy about him, as when he is with Allan Woodcourt. We have to thank you for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I pointed out to my darling how this could scarcely be, because Mr. Woodcourt had come to her cousin John's house, and had known us all there; and because he had always liked Richard, and Richard had always liked him, and&mdash;and so forth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All true,&rdquo; said Ada; &ldquo;but that he is such a devoted friend to us, we owe to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought it best to let my dear girl have her way, and to say no more about it. So I said as much. I said it lightly, because I felt her trembling.</p>
<pb n="585" id="p585"/>
<p>&ldquo;Esther, my dearest, I want to be a good wife, a very, very good wife indeed. You shall teach me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I teach! I said no more; for I noticed the hand that was fluttering over the keys, and I knew that it was not I who ought to speak; that it was she who had something to say to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I married Richard, I was not insensible to what was before him. I had been perfectly happy for a long time with you, and I had never known any trouble or anxiety, so loved and cared for; but I understood the danger he was in, dear Esther.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, I know, my darling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we were married, I had some little hope that I might be able to convince him of his mistake; that he might come to regard it in a new way as my husband, and not pursue it all the more desperately for my sake&mdash;as he does. But if I had not had that hope, I would have married him just the same, Esther. Just the same!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the momentary firmness of the hand that was never still&mdash;a firmness inspired by the utterance of these last words, and dying away with them&mdash;I saw the confirmation of her earnest tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not to think, my dearest Esther, that I fail to see what you see, and fear what you fear. No one can understand him better than I do. The greatest wisdom that ever lived in the world could scarcely know Richard better than my love does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke so modestly and softly, and her trembling hand expressed such agitation, as it moved to and fro upon the silent notes! My dear, dear girl!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see him at his worst, every day. I watch him in his sleep. I know every change of his face. But when I married Richard I was quite determined, Esther, if Heaven would help me, never to show him that I grieved for what he did, and so to make him more unhappy. I want him, when he comes home, to find no trouble in my face. I want him, when he looks at me, to see what he loved in me. I married him to do this, and this supports me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt her trembling more. I waited for what was yet to come, and I now thought I began to know what it was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And something else supports me, Esther.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped a minute. Stopped speaking only; her hand was still in motion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I look forward a little while, and I don't know what great aid may come to me. When Richard turns his eyes upon me then, there may be something lying on my breast more eloquent than I have been, with greater power than mine to show him his true course, and win him back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her hand stopped now. She clasped me in her arms, and I clasped her in mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that little creature should fail too, Esther, I still look forward. I look forward a long while, through years and years, and think that then, when I am growing old, or when I am dead perhaps a beautiful woman, his daughter, happily married, may be proud of him and a blessing to him. Or that a generous brave man, as handsome as he used to be, as hopeful, and far more happy, may walk in the sunshine
<pb n="586" id="p586"/>
with him, honoring his grey head, and saying to himself, &lsquo;I thank God this is my father! ruined by a fatal inheritance, and restored through me!&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>O, my sweet girl, what a heart was that which beat so fast against me! &ldquo;These hopes uphold me, my dear Esther, and I know they will. Though sometimes even they depart from me, before a dread that arises when I look at Richard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I tried to cheer my darling, and asked her what it was? Sobbing and weeping, she replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That he may not live to see his child.&rdquo;</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER LXI. <lb/> A DISCOVERY.</head>
<p>THE days when I frequented that miserable corner which my dear girl brightened, can never fade in my remembrance. I never see it, and I never wish to see it, now; I have been there only once since; but in my memory there is a mournful glory shining on the place, which will shine for ever.</p>
<p>Not a day passed, without my going there, of course. At first I found Mr. Skimpole there, on two or three occasions, idly playing the piano, and talking in his usual vivacious strain. Now, besides my very much mistrusting the probability of his being there without making Richard poorer, I felt as if there were something in his careless gaiety, too inconsistent with what I knew of the depths of Ada's life. I clearly perceived, too, that Ada shared my feelings. I therefore resolved, after much thinking of it, to make a private visit to Mr. Skimpole, and try delicately to explain myself. My dear girl was the great consideration that made me bold.</p>
<p>I set off one morning, accompanied by Charley, for Somers Town. As I approached the house, I was strongly inclined to turn back, for I felt what a desperate attempt it was to make an impression on Mr. Skimpole, and how extremely likely it was that he would signally defeat me. However, I thought that being there, I would go through with it. I knocked with a trembling hand at Mr. Skimpole's door&mdash;literally with a hand, for the knocker was gone&mdash;and after a long parley gained admission from an Irishwoman, who was in the area when I knocked, breaking up the lid of a water-butt with a poker, to light the fire with.</p>
<p>Mr. Skimpole, lying on the sofa in his room, playing the flute a little, was enchanted to see me. Now, who should receive me, he asked? Who would I prefer for mistress of the ceremonies? Would I have his Comedy daughter, his Beauty daughter, or his Sentiment daughter? Or would I have all the daughters at once, in a perfect nosegay?</p>
<p>I replied, half defeated already, that I wished to speak to himself only, if he would give me leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Miss Summerson, most joyfully! Of course,&rdquo; he said, bringing his chair near mine, and breaking into his fascinating smile, &ldquo;of course it's not business. Then it's pleasure!&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="587" id="p587"/>
<p>I said it certainly was not business that I came upon, but it was not quite a pleasant matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, my dear Miss Summerson,&rdquo; said he, with the frankest gaiety, &ldquo;don't allude to it. Why should you allude to anything that is <hi rend="italics">not</hi> a pleasant matter? <hi rend="italics">I</hi> never do. And you are a much pleasanter creature, in every point of view, than I. You are perfectly pleasant; I am imperfectly pleasant; then, if I never allude to an unpleasant matter, how much less should you! So that's disposed of, and we will talk of something else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although I was embarrassed, I took courage to intimate that I still wished to pursue the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think it a mistake,&rdquo; said Mr. Skimpole, with his airy laugh, &ldquo;if I thought Miss Summerson capable of making one. But I don't!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Skimpole,&rdquo; said I, raising my eyes to his, &ldquo;I have so often heard you say that you are unacquainted with the common affairs of life&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning our three banking-house friends, L, S, and who's the junior partner? D?&rdquo; said Mr. Skimpole, brightly. &ldquo;Not an idea of them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;That, perhaps,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;you will excuse my boldness on that account. I think you ought most seriously to know that Richard is poorer than he was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said Mr. Skimpole. &ldquo;So am I, they tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in very embarrassed circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Parallel case exactly!&rdquo; said Mr. Skimpole, with a delighted countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This at present naturally causes Ada much secret anxiety; and as I think she is less anxious when no claims are made upon her by visitors, and as Richard has one uneasiness always heavy on his mind, it has occurred to me to take the liberty of saying that&mdash;if you would&mdash;not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was coming to the point with great difficulty, when he took me by both hands, and, with a radiant face and in the liveliest way, anticipated it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not go there? Certainly not, my dear Miss Summerson, most assuredly not. Why <hi rend="italics">should</hi> I go there? When I go anywhere, I go for pleasure. I don't go anywhere for pain, because I was made for pleasure. Pain comes to <hi rend="italics">me</hi> when it wants me. Now I have had very little pleasure at our dear Richard's, lately, and your practical sagacity demonstrates why. Our young friends, losing the youthful poetry which was once so captivating in them, begin to think, &lsquo;this is a man who wants pounds.&rsquo; So I am; I always want pounds; not for myself, but because tradespeople always want them of me. Next, our young friends begin to think, becoming mercenary, &lsquo;this is the man who <hi rend="italics">had</hi> pounds,&mdash;who borrowed them&rsquo;; which I did. I always borrow pounds. So our young friends, reduced to prose (which is much to be regretted), degenerate in their power of imparting pleasure to me. Why should I go to see them therefore? Absurd!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through the beaming smile with which he regarded me, as he reasoned thus, there now broke forth a look of disinterested benevolence quite astonishing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; he said, pursuing his argument, in his tone of light-hearted conviction, &ldquo;if I don't go anywhere for pain&mdash;which would be a perversion
<pb n="588" id="p588"/>
of the intention of my being, and a monstrous thing to do&mdash;why should I go anywhere to be the cause of pain? If I went to see our young friends in their present ill-regulated state of mind, I should give them pain. The associations with me would be disagreeable. They might say, &lsquo;this is the man who had pounds, and who can't pay pounds,&rsquo; which I can't, of course; nothing could be more out of the question! Then, kindness requires that I shouldn't go near them&mdash;and I won't.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He finished by genially kissing my hand, and thanking me. Nothing but Miss Summerson's fine tact, he said, would have found this out for him.</p>
<p>I was much disconcerted: but I reflected that if the main point were gained, it mattered little how strangely he perverted everything leading to it. I had determined to mention something else, however, and I thought I was not to be put off in that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Skimpole,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I must take the liberty of saying, before I conclude my visit, that I was much surprised to learn, on the best authority, some little time ago, that you knew with whom that poor boy left Bleak House, and that you accepted a present on that occasion. I have not mentioned it to my guardian, for I fear it would hurt him unnecessarily; but I may say to you that I was much surprised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No? Really surprised, my dear Miss Summerson?&rdquo; he returned, inquiringly, raising his pleasant eyebrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Greatly surprised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thought about it for a little while, with a highly agreeable and whimsical expression of face; then quite gave it up, and said, in his most engaging manner:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what a child I am. Why surprised?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was reluctant to enter minutely into that question; but as he begged I would, for he was really curious to know, I gave him to understand, in the gentlest words I could use, that his conduct seemed to involve a disregard of several moral obligations. He was much amused and interested when he heard this, and said, &ldquo;No, really?&rdquo; with ingenuous simplicity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know I don't pretend to be responsible. I never could do it. Responsibility is a thing that has always been above me&mdash;or below me,&rdquo; said Mr. Skimpole, &ldquo;I don't even know which; but, as I understand the way in which my dear Miss Summerson (always remarkable for her practical good sense and clearness) puts this case, I should imagine it was chiefly a question of money, do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I incautiously gave a qualified assent to this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! Then you see,&rdquo; said Mr. Skimpole, shaking his head, &ldquo;I am hopeless of understanding it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I suggested, as I rose to go, that it was not right to betray my guardian's confidence for a bribe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Miss Summerson,&rdquo; he returned, with a candid hilarity that was all his own. &ldquo;I can't be bribed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not by Mr. Bucket?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Not by anybody. I don't attach any value to money. I don't care about it, I don't know about it, I don't want it, I don't keep it&mdash;it goes away from me directly. How can <hi rend="italics">I</hi> be bribed?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="589" id="p589"/>
<p>I showed that I was of a different opinion, though I had not the capacity for arguing the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; said Mr. Skimpole, &ldquo;I am exactly the man to be placed in a superior position, in such a case as that. I am above the rest of mankind, in such a case as that. I can act with philosophy, in such a case as that. I am not warped by prejudices, as an Italian baby is by bandages. I am as free as the air. I feel myself as far above suspicion as C&aelig;sar's wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anything to equal the lightness of his manner, and the playful impartiality with which he seemed to convince himself, as he tossed the matter about like a ball of feathers, was surely never seen in anybody else!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Observe the case, my dear Miss Summerson. Here is a boy received into the house and put to bed, in a state that I strongly object to. The boy being in bed, a man arrives&mdash;like the house that Jack built. Here is the man who demands the boy who is received into the house and put to bed in a state that I strongly object to. Here is a bank-note produced by the man who demands the boy who is received into the house and put to bed in a state that I strongly object to. Here is the Skimpole who accepts the bank-note produced by the man who demands the boy who is received into the house and put to bed in a state that I strongly object to. Those are the facts. Very well. Should the Skimpole have refused the note? <hi rend="italics">Why</hi> should the Skimpole have refused the note? Skimpole protests to Bucket; &lsquo;what's this for? I don't understand it, it is of no use to me, take it away.&rsquo; Bucket still entreats Skimpole to accept it. Are there reasons why Skimpole, not being warped by prejudices, should accept it? Yes. Skimpole perceives them. What are they? Skimpole reasons with himself, this is a tamed lynx, an active police officer, an intelligent man, a person of a peculiarly directed energy and great subtlety both of conception and execution, who discovers our friends and enemies for us when they run away, recovers our property for us when we are robbed, avenges us comfortably when we are murdered. This active police officer and intelligent man has acquired, in the exercise of his art, a strong faith in money; he finds it very useful to him, and he makes it very useful to society. Shall I shake that faith in Bucket, because I want it myself; shall I deliberately blunt one of Bucket's weapons; shall I possibly paralyse Bucket, in his next detective operation? And again. If it is blameable in Skimpole to take the note, it is blameable in Bucket to offer the note&mdash;much more blameable in Bucket, because he is the knowing man. Now, Skimpole wishes to think well of Bucket; Skimpole deems it essential, in its little place, to the general cohesion of things, that he <hi rend="italics">should</hi> think well of Bucket. The State expressly asks him to trust to Bucket. And he does. And that's all he does!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had nothing to offer in reply to this exposition, and therefore took my leave. Mr. Skimpole, however, who was in excellent spirits, would not hear of my returning home attended only by &ldquo;Little Coavinses,&rdquo; and accompanied me himself. He entertained me, on the way, with a variety of delightful conversation; and assured me, at parting, that he should never forget the fine tact with which I had found that out for him about our young friends.</p>
<p>As it so happened that I never saw Mr. Skimpole again, I may at once
<pb n="590" id="p590"/>
finish what I know of his history. A coolness arose between him and my guardian, based chiefly on the foregoing grounds, and on his having heartlessly disregarded my guardian's entreaties (as we afterwards learned from Ada) in reference to Richard. His being heavily in my guardian's debt, had nothing to do with their separation. He died some five years afterwards, and left a diary behind him, with letters and other materials towards his Life; which was published, and which showed him to have been the victim of a combination on the part of mankind against an amiable child. It was considered very pleasant reading, but I never read more of it myself than the sentence on which I chanced to light on opening the book. It was this. &ldquo;Jarndyce, in common with most other men I have known, is the Incarnation of Selfishness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now I come to a part of my story, touching myself very nearly indeed, and for which I was quite unprepared when the circumstance occurred. Whatever little lingerings may have now and then revived in my mind, associated with my poor old face, had only revived as belonging to a part of my life that was gone&mdash;gone like my infancy or my childhood. I have suppressed none of my many weaknesses on that subject, but have written them as faithfully as my memory has recalled them. And I hope to do, and mean to do, the same down to the last words of these pages: which I see now, not so very very far before me.</p>
<p>The months were gliding away; and my dear girl, sustained by the hopes she had confided to me, was the same beautiful star in the miserable corner. Richard, more worn and haggard, haunted the Court day after day; listlessly sat there the whole day long, when he knew there was no remote chance of the suit being mentioned; and became one of the stock sights of the place. I wonder whether any of the gentlemen remembered him as he was when he first went there.</p>
<p>So completely was he absorbed in his fixed idea, that he used to avow in his cheerful moments, that he should never have breathed the fresh air now &ldquo;but for Woodcourt.&rdquo; It was only Mr. Woodcourt who could occasionally divert his attention, for a few hours at a time; and rouse him, even when he sunk into a lethargy of mind and body that alarmed us greatly, and the returns of which became more frequent as the months went on. My dear girl was right in saying that he only pursued his errors the more desperately for her sake. I have no doubt that his desire to retrieve what he had lost, was rendered the more intense by his grief for his young wife, and became like the madness of a gamester.</p>
<p>I was there, as I have mentioned, at all hours. When I was there at night, I generally went home with Charley in a coach; sometimes my guardian would meet me in the neighbourhood, and we would walk home together. One evening, he had arranged to meet me at eight o'clock. I could not leave, as I usually did, quite punctually to the time, for I was working for my dear girl, and had a few stitches more to do, to finish what I was about; but it was within a few minutes of the hour, when I bundled up my little work-basket, gave my darling my last kiss for the night, and hurried down-stairs. Mr. Woodcourt went with me, as it was dusk.</p>
<p>When we came to the usual place of meeting&mdash;it was close by, and
<pb n="591" id="p591"/>
Mr. Woodcourt had often accompanied me before&mdash;my guardian was not there. We waited half an hour, walking up and down; but there were no signs of him. We agreed that he was either prevented from coming, or that he had come, and gone away; and Mr. Woodcourt proposed to walk home with me.</p>
<p>It was the first walk we had ever taken together, except that very short one to the usual place of meeting. We spoke of Richard and Ada the whole way. I did not thank him, in words, for what he had done&mdash;my appreciation of it had risen above all words then&mdash;but I hoped he might not be without some understanding of what I felt so strongly.</p>
<p>Arriving at home and going up-stairs, we found that my guardian was out, and that Mrs. Woodcourt was out too. We were in the very same room into which I had brought my blushing girl, when her youthful lover, now her so altered husband, was the choice of her young heart; the very same room, from which my guardian and I had watched them going away through the sunlight, in the fresh bloom of their hope and promise.</p>
<p>We were standing by the opened window, looking down into the street, when Mr. Woodcourt spoke to me. I learned in a moment that he loved me. I learned in a moment that my scarred face was all unchanged to him. I learned in a moment that what I had thought was pity and compassion, was devoted, generous, faithful love. O, too late to know it now, too late, too late. That was the first ungrateful thought I had. Too late.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I returned,&rdquo; he told me, &ldquo;when I came back, no richer than I went away, and found you newly risen from a sick bed, yet so inspired by sweet consideration for others, and so free from a selfish thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, Mr. Woodcourt, forbear, forbear!&rdquo; I entreated him. &ldquo;I do not deserve your high praise. I had many selfish thoughts at that time, many!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven knows, beloved of my life,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that my praise is not a lover's praise, but the truth. You do not know what all around you see in Esther Summerson, how many hearts she touches and awakens, what sacred admiration and what love she wins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, Mr. Woodcourt,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;it is a great thing to win love, it is a great thing to win love! I am proud of it, and honored by it; and the hearing of it causes me to shed these tears of mingled joy and sorrow&mdash;joy that I have won it, sorrow that I have not deserved it better; but I am not free to think of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said it with a stronger heart; for when he praised me thus, and when I heard his voice thrill with his belief that what he said was true, I aspired to be more worthy of it. It was not too late for that. Although I closed this unforeseen page in my life to-night, I could be worthier of it all through my life. And it was a comfort to me, and an impulse to me, and I felt a dignity rise up within me that was derived from him, when I thought so.</p>
<p>He broke the silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should poorly show the trust that I have in the dear one who will evermore be as dear to me as now,&rdquo; and the deep earnestness with which he said it, at once strengthened me and made me weep, &ldquo;if, after her assurance that she is not free to think of my love, I urged it. Dear
<pb n="592" id="p592"/>
Esther, let me only tell you that the fond idea of you which I took abroad, was exalted to the Heavens when I came home. I have always hoped, in the first hour when I seemed to stand in any ray of good fortune, to tell you this. I have always feared that I should tell it you in vain. My hopes and fears are both fulfilled to-night. I distress you. I have said enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something seemed to pass into my place that was like the Angel he thought me, and I felt so sorrowful for the loss he had sustained! I wished to help him in his trouble, as I had wished to do when he showed that first commiseration for me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Mr. Woodcourt,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;before we part to-night, something is left for me to say. I never could say it as I wish&mdash;I never shall&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had to think again of being more deserving of his love, and his affliction, before I could go on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;I am deeply sensible of your generosity, and I shall treasure its remembrance to my dying hour. I know full well how changed I am, I know you are not unacquainted with my history, and I know what a noble love that is which is so faithful. What you have said to me, could have affected me so much from no other lips; for there are none that could give it such a value to me. It shall not be lost. It shall make me better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He covered his eyes with his hand, and turned away his head. How could I ever be worthy of those tears?</p>
<p>&ldquo;If, in the unchanged intercourse we shall have together&mdash;in tending Richard and Ada; and I hope in many happier scenes of life&mdash;you ever find anything in me which you can honestly think is better than it used to be, believe that it will have sprung up from to-night, and that I shall owe it to you. And never believe, dear dear Mr. Woodcourt, never believe, that I forget this night; or that while my heart beats, it can be insensible to the pride and joy of having been beloved by you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took my hand, and kissed it. He was like himself again, and I felt still more encouraged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am induced, by what you said just now,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;to hope that you have succeeded in your endeavour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;With such help from Mr. Jarndyce, as you who know him so well can imagine him to have rendered me, I have succeeded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven bless him for it,&rdquo; said I, giving him my hand; &ldquo;and Heaven bless you in all you do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall do it better for the wish,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;it will make me enter on these new duties, as on another sacred trust from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! Richard!&rdquo; I exclaimed involuntarily, &ldquo;what will he do when you are gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not required to go yet; I would not desert him, dear Miss Summerson, even if I were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One other thing I felt it needful to touch upon, before he left me. I knew that I should not be worthier of the love I could not take, if I reserved it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Woodcourt,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you will be glad to know from my lips before I say Good night, that in the future, which is clear and bright
<pb n="593" id="p593"/>
before me, I am most happy, most fortunate, have nothing to regret or to desire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was indeed a glad hearing to him, he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From my childhood I have been,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the object of the untiring goodness of the best of human beings; to whom I am so bound by every tie of attachment, gratitude, and love, that nothing I could do in the compass of a life could express the feelings of a single day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I share those feelings,&rdquo; he returned; &ldquo;you speak of Mr. Jarndyce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know his virtues well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but few can know the greatness of his character as I know it. All its highest and best qualities have been revealed to me in nothing more brightly, than in the shaping out of that future in which I am so happy. And if your highest homage and respect had not been his already,&mdash;which I know they are,&mdash;they would have been his, I think, on this assurance, and in the feeling it would have awakened in you towards him for my sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He fervently replied, that indeed indeed they would have been. I gave him my hand again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first, until we meet to-morrow; the second, as a farewell to this theme between us for ever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night; good-bye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lest me, and I stood at the dark window watching the street. His love, in all its constancy and generosity, had come so suddenly upon me, that he had not left me a minute when my fortitude gave way again, and the street was blotted out by my rushing tears.</p>
<p>But they were not tears of regret and sorrow. No. He had called me the beloved of his life, and had said I would be evermore as dear to him as I was then; and I felt as if my heart would not hold the triumph of having heard those words. My first wild thought had died away. It was not too late to hear them, for it was not too late to be animated by them to be good, true, grateful, and contented. How easy my path; how much easier than his!</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER LXII. <lb/> ANOTHER DISCOVERY.</head>
<p>I HAD not the courage to see any one that night. I had not even the courage to see myself, for I was afraid that my tears might a little reproach me. I went up to my room in the dark, and prayed in the dark, and lay down in the dark to sleep. I had no need of any light to read my guardian's letter by, for I knew it by heart. I took it from the place where I kept it, and repeated its contents by its own clear light of integrity and love, and went to sleep with it on my pillow.</p>
<p>I was up very early in the morning, and called Charley to come for a
<pb n="594" id="p594"/>
walk. We bought flowers for the breakfast-table, and came back and arranged them, and were as busy as possible. We were so early, that I had good time still for Charley's lesson, before breakfast; Charley (who was not in the least improved in the old defective article of grammar) came through it with great applause; and we were altogether very notable. When my guardian appeared, he said, &ldquo;Why, little woman, you look fresher than your flowers!&rdquo; And Mrs. Woodcourt repeated and translated a passage from the Mewlinwillinwodd, expressive of my being like a mountain with the sun upon it.</p>
<p>This was all so pleasant, that I hope it made me still more like the mountain than I had been before. After breakfast, I waited my opportunity, and peeped about a little, until I saw my guardian in his own room&mdash;the room of last night&mdash;by himself. Then I made an excuse to go in with my housekeeping keys, shutting the door after me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Dame Durden?&rdquo; said my guardian; the post had brought him several letters, and he was writing. &ldquo;You want money!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed, I have plenty in hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There never was such a Dame Durden,&rdquo; said my guardian, &ldquo;for making money last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had laid down his pen, and leaned back in his chair looking at me. I have often spoken of his bright face, but I thought I had never seen it look so bright and good. There was a high happiness upon it, which made me think, &ldquo;he has been doing some great kindness this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There never was,&rdquo; said my guardian, musing as he smiled upon me, &ldquo;such a Dame Durden for making money last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had never yet altered his old manner. I loved it, and him, so much, that when I now went up to him and took my usual chair, which was always put at his side&mdash;for sometimes I read to him, and sometimes I talked to him, and sometimes I silently worked by him&mdash;I hardly liked to disturb it by laying my hand on his breast. But I found I did not disturb it at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear guardian,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I want to speak to you. Have I been remiss in any thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remiss in anything, my dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have I not been what I have meant to be, since&mdash;I brought the answer to your letter, guardian?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been everything I could desire, my love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very glad indeed to hear that,&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;You know, you said to me, was this the mistress of Bleak House? And I said, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said my guardian, nodding his head. He had put his arm about me, as if there were something to protect me from; and looked in my face, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;we have never spoken on the subject except once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then I said, Bleak House was thinning fast; and so it was, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And <hi rend="italics">I</hi> said,&rdquo; I timidly reminded him, &ldquo;but its mistress remained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He still held me, in the same protecting manner, and with the same bright goodness in his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear guardian,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I know how you have felt all that has happened, and how considerate you have been. As so much time has passed, and as you spoke only this morning of my being so well again,
<pb n="595" id="p595"/>
perhaps you expect me to renew the subject. Perhaps I ought to do so. I will be the mistress of Bleak House when you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; he returned gaily, &ldquo;what a sympathy there must be between us! I have had nothing else, poor Rick excepted&mdash;it's a large exception&mdash;in my mind. When you came in, I was full of it. When shall we give Bleak House its mistress, little woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next month?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next month, dear guardian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The day on which I take the happiest and best step of my life&mdash;the day on which I shall be a man more exulting and more enviable than any other man in the world&mdash;the day on which I give Bleak House its little mistress&mdash;shall be next month, then,&rdquo; said my guardian.</p>
<p>I put my arms round his neck and kissed him, just as I had done on the day when I brought my answer.</p>
<p>A servant came to the door to announce Mr. Bucket, which was quite unnecessary, for Mr. Bucket was already looking in over the servant's shoulder. &ldquo;Mr. Jarndyce and Miss Summerson,&rdquo; said he rather out of breath, &ldquo;with all apologies for intruding, <hi rend="italics">will</hi> you allow me to order up a person that's on the stairs, and that objects to being left there in case of becoming the subject of observations in his absence? Thank you. Be so good as chair that there Member in this direction, will you?&rdquo; said Mr. Bucket, beckoning over the bannisters.</p>
<p>This singular request produced an old man in a black skull-cap, unable to walk, who was carried up by a couple of bearers, and deposited in the room near the door. Mr. Bucket immediately got rid of the bearers, mysteriously shut the door, and bolted it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you see, Mr. Jarndyce,&rdquo; he then began, putting down his hat, and opening his subject with a flourish of his well-remembered finger, &ldquo;you know me, and Miss Summerson knows me. This gentleman likewise knows me, and his name is Smallweed. The discounting line is his line principally, and he's what you may call a dealer in bills. That's about what <hi rend="italics">you</hi> are, you know, ain't you?&rdquo; said Mr. Bucket, stooping a little to address the gentleman in question, who was exceedingly suspicious of him.</p>
<p>He seemed about to dispute this designation of himself, when he was seized with a violent fit of coughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Moral, you know!&rdquo; said Mr. Bucket, improving the accident. &ldquo;Don't you contradict when there ain't no occasion, and you won't be took in that way. Now, Mr. Jarndyce, I address myself to you. I've been negociating with this gentleman on behalf of Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet; and one way and another I've been in and out and about his premises a deal. His premises are the premises formerly occupied by Krook, Marine Store Dealer&mdash;a relation of this gentleman's, that you saw in his life-time, if I don't mistake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My guardian replied &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! You are to understand,&rdquo; said Mr. Bucket, &ldquo;that this gentleman he come into Krook's property, and a good deal of Magpie property there was. Vast lots of waste paper among the rest. Lord bless you, of no use to nobody!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cunning of Mr. Bucket's eye, and the masterly manner in which he contrived, without a look or a word against which his watchful auditor
<pb n="596" id="p596"/>
could protest, to let us know that he stated the case according to previous agreement, and could say much more of Mr. Smallweed if he thought it advisable, deprived us of any merit in quite understanding him. His difficulty was increased by Mr. Smallweed's being deaf as well as suspicious, and watching his face with the closest attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Among them odd heaps of old papers, this gentleman, when he comes into the property, naturally begins to rummage, don't you see?&rdquo; said Mr. Bucket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To which? Say that again,&rdquo; cried Mr. Smallweed, in a shrill, sharp voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To rummage,&rdquo; repeated Mr. Bucket. &ldquo;Being a prudent man, and accustomed to take care of your own affairs, you begin to rummage among the papers as you have come into; don't you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I do,&rdquo; cried Mr. Smallweed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you do,&rdquo; said Mr. Bucket, conversationally, &ldquo;and much to blame you would be if you didn't. And so you chance to find, you know,&rdquo; Mr. Bucket went on, stooping over him with an air of cheerful raillery which Mr. Smallweed by no means reciprocated, &ldquo;and so you chance to find, you know, a paper, with the signature of Jarndyce to it. Don't you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Smallweed glanced with a troubled eye at us, and grudgingly nodded assent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And coming to look at that paper, at your full leisure and convenience&mdash;all in good time, for you're not curious to read it, and why should you be!&mdash;what do you find it to be but a Will, you see. That's the drollery of it,&rdquo; said Mr. Bucket, with the same lively air of recalling a joke for the enjoyment of Mr. Smallweed, who still had the same crest-fallen appearance of not enjoying it at all; &ldquo;what do you find it to be, but a Will?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't know that it's good as a will, or as anything else,&rdquo; snarled Mr. Smallweed.</p>
<p>Mr. Bucket eyed the old man for a moment&mdash;he had slipped and shrunk down in his chair into a mere bundle&mdash;as if he were much disposed to pounce upon him; nevertheless, he continued to bend over him with the same agreeable air, keeping the corner of one of his eyes upon us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Notwithstanding which,&rdquo; said Mr. Bucket, &ldquo;you get a little doubtful and uncomfortable in your mind about it, having a very tender mind of your own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh? What do you say I have got of my own?&rdquo; asked Mr. Smallweed, with his hand to his ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very tender mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho! Well, go on,&rdquo; said Mr. Smallweed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as you've heard a good deal mentioned regarding a celebrated Chancery will case, of the same name; and as you know what a card Krook was for buying all manner of old pieces of furniter, and books, and papers, and what not, and never liking to part with 'em, and always a going to teach himself to read; you begin to think&mdash;and you never was more correct in your born days&mdash;&lsquo;Ecod, if I don't look about me, I may get into trouble regarding this will.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="597" id="p597"/>
<p>&ldquo;Now, mind how you put it, Bucket,&rdquo; cried the old man anxiously, with his hand at his ear. &ldquo;Speak up; none of your brimstone tricks. Pick me up; I want to hear better. O Lord, I am shaken to bits!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bucket had certainly picked him up at a dart. However, as soon as he could be heard though Mr. Smallweed's coughing, and his vicious ejaculations of &ldquo;O my bones! O dear! I've no breath in my body! I'm worse than the chattering, clattering, brimstone pig at home!&rdquo; Mr. Bucket proceeded, in the same convivial manner as before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, as I happen to be in the habit of coming about your premises, you take me into your confidence, don't you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think it would be impossible to make an admission with more ill-will, and a worse grace, than Mr. Smallweed displayed when he admitted this; rendering it perfectly evident that Mr. Bucket was the very last person he would have thought of taking into his confidence, if he could by any possibility have kept him out of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I go into the business with you,&mdash;very pleasant we are over it; and I confirm you in your well-founded fears, that you will-get-your-self-in-to-a-most precious line if you don't come out with that there will,&rdquo; said Mr. Bucket, emphatically; &ldquo;and accordingly you arrange with me that it shall be delivered up to this present Mr. Jarndyce, on no conditions. If it should prove to be valuable, you trusting yourself to him for your reward; that's about where it is, ain't it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's what was agreed,&rdquo; Mr. Smallweed assented, with the same bad grace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In consequence of which,&rdquo; said Mr. Bucket, dismissing his agreeable manner all at once, and becoming strictly business-like, &ldquo;you've got that will upon your person at the present time; and the only thing that remains for you to do is, just to Out with it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having given us one glance out of the watching corner of his eye, and having given his nose one triumphant rub with his fore-finger, Mr. Bucket stood with his eyes fastened on his confidential friend, and his hand stretched forth ready to take the paper and present it to my guardian. It was not produced without much reluctance, and many declarations on the part of Mr. Smallweed that he was a poor industrious man, and that he left it to Mr. Jarndyce's honor not to let him lose by his honesty. Little by little, he very slowly took from a breast-pocket a stained discolored paper, which was much singed upon the outside, and a little burnt at the edges, as if it had long ago been thrown upon a fire, and hastily snatched off again. Mr. Bucket lost no time in transferring this paper, with the dexterity of a conjuror, from Mr. Smallweed to Mr. Jarndyce. As he gave it to my guardian, he whispered behind his fingers:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn't settled how to make their market of it. Quarrelled and hinted about it. I laid out twenty pound upon it. First, the avaricious grandchildren split upon him, on account of their objections to his living so unreasonably long, and then they split on one another. Lord! there ain't one of the family that wouldn't sell the other for a pound or two, except the old lady&mdash;and she's only out of it because she's too weak in her mind to drive a bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bucket,&rdquo; said my guardian aloud, &ldquo;whatever the worth of this
<pb n="598" id="p598"/>
paper may be to any one, my obligations are great to you; and if it be of any worth, I hold myself bound to see Mr. Smallweed remunerated accordingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not according to your merits you know,&rdquo; said Mr. Bucket, in friendly explanation to Mr. Smallweed. &ldquo;Don't you be afraid of that. According to its value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what I mean,&rdquo; said my guardian. &ldquo;You may observe, Mr. Bucket, that I abstain from examining this paper myself. The plain truth is, I have forsworn and abjured the whole business these many years, and my soul is sick of it. But Miss Summerson and I will immediately place the paper in the hands of my solicitor in the cause, and its existence shall be made known without delay to all other parties interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Jarndyce can't say fairer than that, you understand,&rdquo; observed Mr. Bucket, to his fellow visitor. &ldquo;And it being now made clear to you that nobody's a going to be wronged&mdash;which must be a great relief to <hi rend="italics">your</hi> mind&mdash;we may proceed with the ceremony of chairing you home again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He unbolted the door, called in the bearers, wished us good morning, and with a look full of meaning, and a crook of his finger at parting, went his way.</p>
<p>We went our way too, which was to Lincoln's Inn, as quickly as possible. Mr. Kenge was disengaged; and we found him at his table in his dusty room, with the inexpressive-looking books, and the piles of papers. Chairs having been placed for us by Mr. Guppy, Mr. Kenge expressed the surprise and gratification he felt at the unusual sight of Mr. Jarndyce in his office. He turned over his double eye-glass as he spoke, and was more Conversation Kenge than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; said Mr. Kenge, &ldquo;that the genial influence of Miss Summerson,&rdquo; he bowed to me, &ldquo;may have induced Mr. Jarndyce,&rdquo; he bowed to him, &ldquo;to forego some little of his animosity towards a Cause and towards a Court which are&mdash;shall I say, which take their place in the stately vista of the pillars of our profession?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am inclined to think,&rdquo; returned my guardian, &ldquo;that Miss Summerson has seen too much of the effects of the Court and the Cause to exert any influence in their favor. Nevertheless, they are a part of the occasion of my being here. Mr. Kenge, before I lay this paper on your desk and have done with it, let me tell you how it has come into my hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did so shortly and distinctly. &ldquo;It could not, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Kenge, &ldquo;have been stated more plainly and to the purpose, if it had been a case at law.&rdquo; &ldquo;Did you ever know English law, or equity either, plain and to the purpose?&rdquo; said my guardian. &ldquo;O fie!&rdquo; said Mr. Kenge.</p>
<p>At first he had not seemed to attach much importance to the paper but when he saw it he appeared more interested, and when he had opened and read a little of it through his eye-glass, he became amazed. &ldquo;Mr. Jarndyce,&rdquo; he said, looking off it, &ldquo;you have perused this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I!&rdquo; returned my guardian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Kenge, &ldquo;it is a Will of later date than any in the suit. It appears to be all in the Testator's handwriting. It is duly executed and attested. And even if intended to be cancelled, as
<pb n="599" id="p599"/>
might possibly be supposed to be denoted by these marks of fire, it is <hi rend="italics">not</hi> cancelled. Here it is, a perfect instrument!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said my guardian. &ldquo;What is that to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Guppy!&rdquo; cried Mr. Kenge, raising his voice.&mdash;&ldquo;I beg your pardon, Mr. Jarndyce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Vholes of Symond's Inn. My compliments. Jarndyce and Jarndyce. Glad to speak with him.</p>
<p>Mr. Guppy disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ask me what is this to you, Mr. Jarndyce. If you had perused this document, you would have seen that it reduces your interest considerably, though still leaving it a very handsome one, still leaving it a very handsome one,&rdquo; said Mr. Kenge, waving his hand persuasively and blandly. &ldquo;You would further have seen, that the interests of Mr. Richard Carstone, and of Miss Ada Clare, now Mrs. Richard Carstone, are very materially advanced by it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kenge,&rdquo; said my guardian, &ldquo;if all the flourishing wealth that the suit brought into this vile court of Chancery could fall to my two young cousins, I should be well contented. But do you ask <hi rend="italics">me</hi> to believe that any good is to come of Jarndyce and Jarndyce?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O really, Mr. Jarndyce! Prejudice, prejudice. My dear sir, this is a very great country, a very great country. Its system of equity is a very great system, a very great system. Really, really!&rdquo;</p>
<p>My guardian said no more, and Mr. Vholes arrived. He was modestly impressed by Mr. Kenge's professional eminence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Vholes? Will you be so good as to take a chair here by me, and look over this paper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Vholes did as he was asked, and seemed to read it every word. He was not excited by it; but he was not excited by anything. When he had well examined it, he retired with Mr. Kenge into a window, and shading his mouth with his black glove, spoke to him at some length. I was not surprised to observe Mr. Kenge inclined to dispute what he said before he had said much, for I knew that no two people ever did agree about anything in Jarndyce and Jarndyce. But he seemed to get the better of Mr. Kenge too, in a conversation that sounded as if it were almost composed of the words, &ldquo;Receiver-General,&rdquo; &ldquo;Accountant-General,&rdquo; &ldquo;Report,&rdquo; &ldquo;Estate,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Costs.&rdquo; When they had finished, they came back to Mr. Kenge's table, and spoke aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! But this is a very remarkable document, Mr. Vholes?&rdquo; said Mr. Kenge.</p>
<p>Mr. Vholes said, &ldquo;Very much so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a very important document, Mr. Vholes?&rdquo; said Mr. Kenge. Again Mr. Vholes said, &ldquo;Very much so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as you say, Mr. Vholes, when the Cause is in the paper next Term, this document will be an unexpected and interesting feature in it,&rdquo; said Mr. Kenge, looking loftily at my guardian.</p>
<p>Mr. Vholes was gratified, as a smaller practitioner striving to keep respectable, to be confirmed in any opinion of his own by such an authority.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when,&rdquo; asked my guardian, rising after a pause, during which
<pb n="600" id="p600"/>
Mr. Kenge had rattled his money, and Mr. Vholes had picked his pimples, &ldquo;when is next Term?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next Term, Mr. Jarndyce, will be next month,&rdquo; said Mr. Kenge. &ldquo;Of course we shall at once proceed to do what is necessary with this document, and to collect the necessary evidence concerning it; and of course you will receive our usual notification of the Cause being in the paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To which I shall pay, of course, my usual attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still bent, my dear sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Kenge, shewing us through the outer office to the door, &ldquo;still bent, even with your enlarged mind, on echoing a popular prejudice? We are a prosperous community, Mr. Jarndyce, a very prosperous community. We are a great country, Mr. Jarndyce, we are a very great country. This is a great system, Mr. Jarndyce, and would you wish a great country to have a little system? Now, really, really!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said this at the stair-head, gently moving his right hand as if it were a silver trowel, with which to spread the cement of his words on the structure of the system, and consolidate it for a thousand ages.</p>

<head>CHAPTER LXIII. <lb/> STEEL AND IRON.</head>
<p>GEORGE'S shooting-gallery is to let, and the stock is sold off, and George himself is at Chesney Wold, attending on Sir Leicester in his rides, and riding very near his bridle-rein, because of the uncertain hand with which he guides his horse. But not to-day is George so occupied. He is journeying to-day into the iron country farther north, to look about him.</p>
<p>As he comes into the iron country farther north, such fresh green woods as those of Chesney Wold are left behind; and coalpits and ashes, high chimnies and red bricks, blighted verdure, scorching fires, and a heavy never-lightening cloud of smoke, become the features of the scenery. Among such objects rides the trooper, looking about him, and always looking for something he has come to find.</p>
<p>At last, on the black canal bridge of a busy town, with a clang of iron in it, and more fires and more smoke than he has seen yet, the trooper, swart with the dust of the coal roads, checks his horse, and asks a workman does he know the name of Rouncewell thereabouts?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, master,&rdquo; quoth the workman, &ldquo;do I know my own name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;'Tis so well known here, is it, comrade?&rdquo; asks the trooper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rouncewells? Ah! you're right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where might it be now?&rdquo; asks the trooper, with a glance before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bank, the factory, or the house?&rdquo; the workman wants to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum! Rouncewells is so great apparently,&rdquo; mutters the trooper,
<pb n="601" id="p601"/>
stroking his chin, &ldquo;that I have as good as half a mind to go back again. Why, I don't know which I want. Should I find Mr. Rouncewell at the factory, do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;'Tain't easy to say where you'd find him&mdash;at this time of the day you might find either him or his son there, if he's in town; but his contracts take him away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And which is the factory? Why, he sees those chimnies&mdash;the tallest ones! Yes, he sees <hi rend="italics">them.</hi> Well! let him keep his eye on those chimnies, going on as straight as ever he can, and presently he'll see 'em down a turning on the left, shut in by a great brick wall which forms one side of the street. That's Rouncewells.</p>
<p>The trooper thanks his informant, and rides slowly on, looking about him. He does not turn back, but puts up his horse (and is much disposed to groom him too) at a public-house where some of Rouncewell's hands are dining, as the ostler tells him. Some of Rouncewell's hands have just knocked off for dinner time, and seem to be invading the whole town. They are very sinewy and strong, are Rouncewell's hands&mdash;a little sooty too.</p>
<p>He comes to a gateway in the brick wall, looks in, and sees a great perplexity of iron lying about, in every stage, and in a vast variety of shapes; in bars, in wedges, in sheets; in tanks, in boilers, in axles, in wheels, in cogs, in cranks, in rails; twisted and wrenched into eccentric and perverse forms, as separate parts of machinery; mountains of it broken-up, and rusty in its age; distant furnaces of it glowing and bubbling in its youth; bright fireworks of it showering about, under the blows of the steam hammer; red-hot iron, white-hot iron, cold-black iron; an iron taste, an iron smell, and a Babel of iron sounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a place to make a man's head ache, too!&rdquo; says the trooper, looking about him for a counting-house. &ldquo;Who comes here? This is very like me before I was set up. This ought to be my nephew, if likenesses run in families. Your servant, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yours, sir. Are you looking for any one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me. Young Mr. Rouncewell, I believe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was looking for your father, sir. I wished to have a word with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man, telling him he is fortunate in his choice of a time, for his father is there, leads the way to the office where he is to be found. &ldquo;Very like me before I was set up&mdash;devilish like me!&rdquo; thinks the trooper, as he follows. They come to a building in the yard; with an office on an upper floor. At sight of the gentleman in the office, Mr. George turns very red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What name shall I say to my father?&rdquo; asks the young man.</p>
<p>George, full of the idea of iron, in desperation answers &ldquo;Steel,&rdquo; and is so presented. He is left alone with the gentleman in the office, who sits at a table with account-books before him, and some sheets of paper, blotted with hosts of figures and drawings of cunning shapes. It is a bare office, with bare windows, looking on the iron view below. Tumbled together on the table are some pieces of iron, purposely broken to be tested, at various period of their service, in various capacities. There is iron-dust on everything; and the smoke is seen,
<pb n="602" id="p602"/>
through the windows, rolling heavily out of the tall chimnies, to mingle with the smoke from a vaporous Babylon of other chimnies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am at your service, Mr. Steel,&rdquo; says the gentleman, when his visitor has taken a rusty chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Rouncewell,&rdquo; George replies, leaning forward, with his left arm on his knee, and his hat in his hand; and very chary of meeting his brother's eye; &ldquo;I am not without my expectations, that in the present visit I may prove to be more free than welcome. I have served as a Dragoon in my day; and a comrade of mine that I was once rather partial to, was, if I don't deceive myself, a brother of yours. I believe you had a brother who gave his family some trouble, and ran away, and never did any good but in keeping away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you quite sure,&rdquo; returns the ironmaster, in an altered voice, &ldquo;that your name is Steel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trooper falters, and looks at him. His brother starts up, calls him by his name, and grasps him by both hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are too quick for me!&rdquo; cries the trooper, with the tears springing out of his eyes. &ldquo;How do you do, my dear old fellow. I never could have thought you would have been half so glad to see me as all this. How do you do, my dear old fellow, how do you do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They shake hands, and embrace each other, over and over again; the trooper still coupling his &ldquo;How do you do, my dear old fellow!&rdquo; with his protestation that he never thought his brother would have been half so glad to see him as all this!</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far from it,&rdquo; he declares, at the end of a full account of what has preceded his arrival there, &ldquo;I had very little idea of making myself known. I thought, if you took by any means forgivingly to my name, I might gradually get myself up to the point of writing a letter. But I should not have been surprised, brother, if you had considered it anything but welcome news to hear of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will show you at home what kind of news we think it, George,&rdquo; returns his brother. &ldquo;This is a great day at home, and you could not have arrived, you bronzed old soldier, on a better. I make an agreement with my son Watt to-day, that on this day twelvemonth he shall marry as pretty and as good a girl as you have seen in all your travels. She goes to Germany to-morrow, with one of your nieces, for a little polishing up in her education. We make a feast of the event, and you will be made the hero of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. George is so entirely overcome at first by this prospect, that he resists the proposed honor with great earnestness. Being overborne, however, by his brother and his nephew&mdash;concerning whom he renews his protestations that he never could have thought they would have been half so glad to see him&mdash;he is taken home to an elegant house, in all the arrangements of which there is to be observed a pleasant mixture of the originally simple habits of the father and mother, with such as are suited to their altered station and the higher fortunes of their children. Here, Mr. George is much dismayed by the graces and accomplishments of his nieces that are; and by the beauty of Rosa, his niece that is to be; and by the affectionate salutations of these young ladies, which he receives in a sort of dream. He is sorely taken aback, too, by the dutiful behaviour of his nephew; and has a woful consciousness upon him of being a scapegrace.
<pb n="603" id="p603"/>
However, there is great rejoicing, and a very hearty company, and infinite enjoyment; and Mr. George comes bluff and martial through it all; and his pledge to be present at the marriage and give away the bride, is received with universal favor. A whirling head has Mr. George that night, when he lies down in the state-bed of his brother's house, to think of all these things, and to see the images of his nieces (awfull all the evening in their floating muslins), waltzing, after the German manner, over his counterpane.</p>
<p>The brothers are closeted next morning in the ironmaster's room; where the elder is proceeding, in his clear sensible way, to show how he thinks he may best dispose of George in his business, when George squeezes his hand and stops him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother, I thank you a million times for your more than brotherly welcome, and a million times more to that for your more than brotherly intentions. But my plans are made. Before I say a word as to them, I wish to consult you upon one family point. How,&rdquo; says the trooper, folding his arms, and looking with indomitable firmness at his brother, &ldquo;how is my mother to be got to scratch me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not sure that I understand you, George,&rdquo; replies the ironmaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, brother, how is my mother to be got to scratch me? She must be got to do it, somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scratch you out of her will, I think you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I do. In short,&rdquo; says the trooper, folding his arms more resolutely yet, &ldquo;I mean&mdash;<hi rend="italics">to</hi>&mdash;scratch me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear George,&rdquo; returns his brother, &ldquo;is it so indispensable that you should undergo that process?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite! Absolutely! I couldn't be guilty of the meanness of coming back without it. I should never be safe not to be off again. I have not sneaked home to rob your children, if not yourself, brother, of your rights. I, who forfeited mine long ago! If I am to remain, and hold up my head, I must be scratched. Come. You are a man of celebrated penetration and intelligence, and you can tell me how it's to be brought about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can tell you, George,&rdquo; replies the ironmaster, deliberately, &ldquo;how it is not to be brought about, which I hope may answer the purpose as well. Look at our mother, think of her, recal her emotion when she recovered you. Do you believe there is a consideration in the world that would induce her to take such a step against her favorite son? Do you believe there is any chance of her consent, to balance against the outrage it would be to her (loving dear old lady!) to propose it? If you do, you are wrong. No, George! You must make up your mind to remain <hi rend="italics">un</hi>scratched. I think,&rdquo; there is an amused smile on the ironmaster's face, as he watches his brother, who is pondering, deeply disappointed, &ldquo;I think you may manage almost as well as if the thing were done, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Being bent upon it, you can dispose by will of anything you have the misfortune to inherit, in any way you like, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's true!&rdquo; says the trooper, pondering again. Then he wistfully asks, with his hand on his brother's, &ldquo;Would you mind mentioning that, brother, to your wife and family?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="604" id="p604"/>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you. You wouldn't object to say, perhaps, that although an undoubted vagabond, I am a vagabond of the harum scarum order, and not of the mean sort?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ironmaster, repressing his amused smile, assents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you. Thank you. It's a weight off my mind,&rdquo; says the trooper, with a heave of his chest as he unfolds his arms, and puts a hand on each leg; &ldquo;though I had set my heart on being scratched, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The brothers are very like each other, sitting face to face; but a certain massive simplicity, and absence of usage in the ways of the world, is all on the trooper's side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he proceeds, throwing off his disappointment, &ldquo;next and last, those plans of mine. You have been so brotherly as to propose to me to fall in here, and take my place among the products of your perseverance and sense. I thank you heartily. It's more than brotherly, as I said before; and I thank you heartily for it,&rdquo; shaking him a long time by the hand. &ldquo;But the truth is, brother, I am a&mdash;I am a kind of a Weed, and it's too late to plant me in a regular garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear George,&rdquo; returns the elder, concentrating his strong steady brow upon him, and smiling confidently; &ldquo;leave that to me, and let me try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George shakes his head. &ldquo;You could do it, I have not a doubt, if anybody could; but it's not to be done. Not to be done, sir! Whereas it so falls out, on the other hand, that I am able to be of some trifle of use to Sir Leicester Dedlock since his illness&mdash;brought on by family sorrows; and that he would rather have that help from our mother's son than from anybody else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear George,&rdquo; returns the other, with a very slight shade upon his open face, &ldquo;if you prefer to serve in Sir Leicester Dedlock's household brigade&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There it is, brother!&rdquo; cries the trooper, checking him, with his hand upon his knee again: &ldquo;there it is! You don't take kindly to that idea; I don't mind it. You are not used to being officered; I am. Everything about you is in perfect order and discipline; everything about me requires to be kept so. We are not accustomed to carry things with the same hand, or to look at 'em from the same point. I don't say much about my garrison manners, because I found myself pretty well at my ease last night, and they wouldn't be noticed here, I dare say, once and away. But I shall get on best at Chesney Wold&mdash;where there's more room for a Weed than there is here; and the dear old lady will be made happy besides. Therefore I accept of Sir Leicester Dedlock's proposals. When I come over next year to give away the bride, or whenever I come, I shall have the sense to keep the household brigade in ambuscade and not to manoeuvre it on your ground. I thank you heartily again, and am proud to think of the Rouncewells as they'll be founded by you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know yourself, George,&rdquo; says the elder brother, returning the grip of his hand, &ldquo;and perhaps you know me better than I know myself. Take your way. So that we don't quite lose one another again, take your way.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="605" id="p605"/>
<p>&ldquo;No fear of that!&rdquo; returns the trooper. &ldquo;Now, before I turn my horse's head homeards, brother, I will ask you&mdash;if you'll be so good&mdash;to look over a letter for me. I brought it with me to send from these parts, as Chesney Wold might be a painful name just now to the person it's written to. I am not much accustomed to correspondence myself, and I am particular respecting this present letter, because I want it to be both straightforward and delicate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herewith he hands a letter, closely written in somewhat pale ink but in a neat round hand, to the ironmaster, who reads as follows:</p>

I duly observed the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I further take the liberty to make known to you, that it was got from me as a proof of hand-writing only, and that otherwise I would not have given it up as appearing to be the most harmless in my possession, without being previously shot through the heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I further take the liberty to mention, that if I could have supposed a certain unfortunate gentleman to have been in existence, I never could and never would have rested until I had discovered his retreat, and shared my last farthing with him, as my duty and my inclination would have equally been. But he was (officially) reported drowned, and assuredly went over the side of a transport-ship at night in an Irish harbor, within a few hours of her arrival from the West Indies, as I have myself heard both from officers and men on board, and know to have been (officially) confirmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I further take the liberty to state that in my humble quality as one of the rank and file, I am, and shall ever continue to be, your thoroughly devoted and admiring servant, and that I esteem the qualities you possess above all others, far beyond the limits of the present dispatch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little formal,&rdquo; observes the elder brother, refolding it with a puzzled face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But nothing that might not be sent to a pattern young lady?&rdquo; asks the younger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Therefore it is sealed, and deposited for posting among the iron correspondence of the day. This done, Mr. George takes a hearty farewell of the family party, and prepares to saddle and mount. His brother, however, unwilling to part with him so soon, proposes to ride with him in a light open carriage to the place where he will bait for the night, and there remain with him until morning: a servant riding, for so much of the journey, on the thorough-bred old grey from Chesney Wold. The offer being gladly accepted, is followed by a pleasant ride, a pleasant dinner, and a pleasant breakfast all in brotherly communion. Then they once more shake hands long and heartily, and part; the ironmaster turning his face to the smoke and fires, and the trooper to the green country. Early in the afternoon, the subdued sound of his heavy military trot is heard on the turf in the avenue, as he rides on with imaginary clank and jingle of accoutrements under the old elm trees.</p>

<head>CHAPTER LXIV. <lb/> ESTHER'S NARRATIVE.</head>
<p>SOON after I had had that conversation with my guardian, he put a sealed paper in my hand one morning, and said, &ldquo;This is for next month, my dear.&rdquo; I found in it two hundred pounds.</p>
<p>I now began very quietly to make such preparations as I thought were necessary. Regulating my purchases by my guardian's taste, which I knew very well of course, I arranged my wardrobe to please him, and hoped I should be highly successful. I did it all so quietly, because I was not quite free from my old apprehension that Ada would be rather sorry, and because my guardian was so quiet himself. I had no doubt that under all the circumstances we should be married in the most private and simple manner. Perhaps I should only have to say to Ada, &ldquo;Would you like to come and see me married to-morrow, my pet?&rdquo; Perhaps our wedding might even be as unpretending as her own, and I might not find it necessary to say anything about it until it was over. I thought that if I were to choose, I would like this best.</p>
<p>The only exception I made was Mrs. Woodcourt. I told her that I was going to be married to my guardian, and that we had been engaged some time. She highly approved. She could never do enough for me; and was remarkably softened now, in comparison with what she had been when we first knew her. There was no trouble she would not have taken to have been of use to me; but I need hardly say that I only allowed her to take as little, as gratified her kindness without tasking it.</p>
<p>Of course this was not a time to neglect my guardian; and of course it was not a time for neglecting my darling. So I had plenty of occupation&mdash;which I was glad of; and as to Charley, she was absolutely not to be seen for needlework. To surround herself with great heaps of it&mdash;baskets full and tables full&mdash;and do a little, and spend a great deal of time in staring with her round eyes at what there was to do, and persuade herself that she was going to do it, were Charley's great dignities and delights.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I must say, I could not agree with my guardian on the subject of the Will, and I had some sanguine hopes of Jarndyce and Jarndyce. Which of us was right will soon appear, but I certainly did encourage expectations. In Richard, the discovery gave occasion for a burst of business and agitation that buoyed him up for a little time; but he had lost the elasticity even of hope now, and seemed to me to retain only its feverish anxieties. From something my guardian said one day, when we were talking about this, I understood that my marriage would not take place until after the Term-time we had been told to look forward to; and I thought the more, for that, how rejoiced I should be if I could be married when Richard and Ada were a little more prosperous.</p>
<p>The Term was very near indeed, when my guardian was called out of town, and went down into Yorkshire on Mr. Woodcourt's business. He
<pb n="607" id="p607"/>
had told me beforehand that his presence there would be necessary. I had just come in one night from my dear girl's, and was sitting in the midst of all my new clothes, looking at them all around me, and thinking, when a letter from my guardian was brought to me. It asked me to join him in the country; and mentioned by what stage-coach my place was taken, and at what time in the morning I should have to leave town. It added in a postscript that I would not be many hours from Ada.</p>
<p>I expected few things less than a journey at that time, but I was ready for it in half-an-hour, and set off as appointed early next morning. I travelled all day, wondering all day what I could be wanted for at such a distance; now I thought it might be for this purpose, and now I thought it might be for that purpose; but I was never, never, never near the truth.</p>
<p>It was night when I came to my journey's end, and found my guardian waiting for me. This was a great relief, for towards evening I had begun to fear (the more so as his letter was a very short one) that he might be ill. However, there he was, as well as it was possible to be; and when I saw his genial face again at its brightest and best, I said to myself he has been doing some other great kindness. Not that it required much penetration to say that, because I knew that his being there at all was an act of kindness.</p>
<p>Supper was ready at the hotel, and when we were alone at table he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Full of curiosity, no doubt, little woman, to know why I have brought you here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, guardian,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;without thinking myself a Fatima, or you a Blue Beard, I am a little curious about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then to ensure your night's rest, my love,&rdquo; he returned, gaily, &ldquo;I won't wait until to-morrow to tell you. I have very much wished to express to Woodcourt, somehow, my sense of his humanity to poor unfortunate Jo, his inestimable services to my young cousins, and his value to us all. When it was decided that he should settle here, it came into my head that I might ask his acceptance of some unpretending and suitable little place, to lay his own head in. I therefore caused such a place to be looked out for, and such a place was found on very easy terms, and I have been touching it up for him and making it habitable. However, when I walked over it the day before yesterday, and it was reported ready, I found that I was not housekeeper enough to know whether things were all as they ought to be. So I sent off for the best little housekeeper that could possibly be got, to come and give me her advice and opinion. And here she is,&rdquo; said my guardian, &ldquo;laughing and crying both together!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because he was so dear, so good, so admirable. I tried to tell him what I thought of him, but I could not articulate a word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut, tut!&rdquo; said my guardian. &ldquo;You make too much of it, little woman. Why how you sob, Dame Durden how you sob!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is with exquisite pleasure, guardian&mdash;with a heart full of thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I am delighted that you approve. I thought you would. I meant it as a pleasant surprise for the little mistress of Bleak House.&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="608" id="p608"/>
<p>I kissed him, and dried my eyes. &ldquo;I know now!&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I have seen this in your face a long while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; have you really, my dear?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;What a Dame Durden it is to read a face!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was so quaintly cheerful that I could not long be otherwise, and was almost ashamed of having been otherwise at all. When I went to bed, I cried. I am bound to confess that I cried; but I hope it was with pleasure, though I am not quite sure it was with pleasure. I repeated every word of the letter twice over.</p>
<p>A most beautiful summer morning succeeded; and after breakfast we went out arm in arm, to see the house of which I was to give my mighty housekeeping opinion. We entered a flower-garden by a gate in a side wall, of which he had the key; and the first thing I saw, was, that the beds and flowers were all laid out according to the manner of my beds and flowers at home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, my dear,&rdquo; observed my guardian, standing still, with a delighted face, to watch my looks; &ldquo;knowing there could be no better plan, I borrowed yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We went on by a pretty little orchard, where the cherries were nestling among the green leaves, and the shadows of the apple-trees were sporting on the grass, to the house itself,&mdash;a cottage, quite a rustic cottage of doll's rooms; but such a lovely place, so tranquil and so beautiful, with such a rich and smiling country spread around it; with water sparkling away into the distance, here all overhung with summer-growth, there turning a humming mill; at its nearest point glancing through a meadow by the cheerful town, where cricket-players were assembling in bright groups, and a flag was flying from a white tent that rippled in the sweet west wind. And still, as we went through the pretty rooms, out at the little rustic verandah doors, and underneath the tiny wooden colonnades, garlanded with woodbine, jasmine, and honeysuckle, I saw, in the papering on the walls, in the colors of the furniture, in the arrangement of all the pretty objects, <hi rend="italics">my</hi> little tastes and fancies, <hi rend="italics">my</hi> little methods and inventions which they used to laugh at while they praised them, my odd ways everywhere.</p>
<p>I could not say enough in admiration of what was all so beautiful, but one secret doubt arose in my mind, when I saw this. I thought, O would he be the happier for it! Would it not have been better for his peace that I should not have been so brought before him? Because, although I was not what he thought me, still he loved me very dearly, and it might remind him mournfully of what he believed he had lost. I did not wish him to forget me,&mdash;perhaps he might not have done so, without these aids to his memory,&mdash;but my way was easier than his, and I could have reconciled myself even to that, so that he had been the happier for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, little woman,&rdquo; said my guardian, whom I had never seen so proud and joyful as in showing me these things, and watching my appreciation of them, &ldquo;now, last of all, for the name of this house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it called, dear guardian?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My child,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;come and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took me to the porch, which he had hitherto avoided, and said, pausing before we went out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear child, don't you guess the name?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="609" id="p609"/>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>We went out of the porch; and he showed me written over it, BLEAK HOUSE.</p>
<p>He led me to a seat among the leaves close by, and sitting down beside me, and taking my hand in his, spoke to me thus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My darling girl, in what there has been between us, I have, I hope, been really solicitous for your happiness. When I wrote you the letter to which you brought the answer,&rdquo; smiling as he referred to it, &ldquo;I had my own too much in view; but I had yours too. Whether, under different circumstances, I might ever have renewed the old dream I sometimes dreamed when you were very young, of making you my wife one day, I need not ask myself. I did renew it, and I wrote my letter, and you brought your answer. You are following what I say, my child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was cold, and I trembled violently; but not a word he uttered was lost. As I sat looking fixedly at him, and the sun's rays descended, softly shining through the leaves, upon his bare head, I felt as if the brightness on him must be like the brightness of the Angels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear me, my love, but do not speak. It is for me to speak now. When it was that I began to doubt whether what I had done would really make you happy, is no matter. Woodcourt came home, and I soon had no doubt at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I clasped him round the neck, and hung my head upon his breast, and wept. &ldquo;Lie lightly, confidently, here, my child,&rdquo; said he, pressing me gently to him. &ldquo;I am your guardian and your father now. Rest confidently here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soothingly, like the gentle rustling of the leaves; and genially, like the ripening weather; and radiantly and beneficently, like the sunshine; he went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Understand me, my dear girl. I had no doubt of your being contented and happy with me, being so dutiful and so devoted; but I saw with whom you would be happier. That I penetrated his secret when Dame Durden was blind to it, is no wonder; for I knew the good that could never change in her, better far than she did. Well! I have long been in Allan Woodcourt's confidence, although he was not, until yesterday, a few hours before you came here, in mine. But I would not have my Esther's bright example lost; I would not have a jot of my dear girl's virtues unobserved and unhonored; I would not have her admitted on sufferance into the line of Morgan ap Kerrig, no, not for the weight in gold of all the mountains in Wales!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped to kiss me on the forehead, and I sobbed and wept afresh. For I felt as if I could not bear the painful delight of his praise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, little woman! Don't cry; this is to be a day of joy. I have looked forward to it,&rdquo; he said, exultingly, &ldquo;for months on months! A few words more, Dame Trot, and I have said my say. Determined not to throw away one atom of my Esther's worth, I took Mrs. Woodcourt into a separate confidence. &lsquo;Now madam,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I clearly perceive&mdash;and indeed I know, to boot&mdash;that your son loves my ward. I am further very sure that my ward loves your son, but will sacrifice her love to a sense of duty and affection, and will sacrifice it so completely, so entirely, so religiously, that you should never suspect it, though you watched her night and day.&rsquo; Then I told her all our story&mdash;ours&mdash;yours and mine.
<pb n="610" id="p610"/>
&lsquo;Now, madam,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;come you, knowing this, and live with us. Come you, and see my child from hour to hour; set what you see, against her pedigree, which is this, and this&rsquo;&mdash;for I scorned to mince it&mdash;&lsquo;and tell me what is the true legitimacy, when you shall have quite made up your mind on that subject.&rsquo; Why, honor to her old Welch blood, my dear!&rdquo; cried my guardian, with enthusiasm, &ldquo;I believe the heart it animates beats no less warmly, no less admiringly, no less lovingly, towards Dame Durden, than my own!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tenderly raised my head, and as I clung to him, kissed me in his old fatherly way again and again. What a light, now, on the protecting manner I had thought about!</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more last word. When Allan Woodcourt spoke to you, my dear, he spoke with my knowledge and consent&mdash;but I gave him no encouragement, not I, for these surprises were my great reward, and I was too miserly to part with a scrap of it. He was to come, and tell me all that passed; and he did. I have no more to say. My dearest, Allan Woodcourt stood beside your father when he lay dead&mdash;stood beside your mother. This is Bleak House. This day I give this house its little mistress; and before God, it is the brightest day in all my life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose, and raised me with him. We were no longer alone. My husband&mdash;I have called him by that name full seven happy years now&mdash;stood at my side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allan,&rdquo; said my guardian, &ldquo;take from me, a willing gift, the best wife that ever a man had. What more can I say for you, than that I know you deserve her! Take with her the little home she brings you. You know what she will make it, Allan; you know what she has made its namesake. Let me share its felicity sometimes, and what do I sacrifice? Nothing, nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He kissed me once again; and now the tears were in his eyes, as he said more softly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Esther, my dearest, after so many years, there is a kind of parting in this too. I know that my mistake has caused you some distress. Forgive your old guardian, in restoring him to his old place in your affections; and blot it out of your memory. Allan, take my dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He moved away from under the green roof of leaves, and stopping in the sunlight outside, and turning cheerfully towards us, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be found about here somewhere. It's a West wind, little woman, due West! Let no one thank me any more; for I am going to revert to my bachelor habits, and if anybody disregards this warning, I'll run away, and never come back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>What happiness was our's that day, what joy, what rest, what hope, what gratitude, what bliss! We were to be married before the month was out; but when we were to come and take possession of our own house, was to depend on Richard and Ada.</p>
<p>We all three went home together next day. As soon as we arrived in town Allan went straight to see Richard, and to carry our joyful news to him and my darling. Late as it was, I meant to go to her for a few minutes before lying down to sleep: but I went home with my guardian first, to make his tea for him, and to occupy the old chair by his side; for I did not like to think of its being empty so soon.</p>
<pb n="611" id="p611"/>
<p>When we came home, we found that a young man had called three times in the course of that one day, to see me; and that, having been told, on the occasion of his third call, that I was not expected to return before ten o'clock at night, he had left word, &ldquo;that he would call about then.&rdquo; He had left his card three times. MR. GUPPY.</p>
<p>As I naturally speculated on the object of these visits, and as I always associated something ludicrous with the visitor, it fell out that in laughing about Mr. Guppy I told my guardian of his old proposal, and his subsequent retractation. &ldquo;After that,&rdquo; said my guardian, &ldquo;we will certainly receive this hero.&rdquo; So, instructions were given that Mr. Guppy should be shown in, when he came again; and they were scarcely given when he did come again.</p>
<p>He was embarrassed when he found my guardian with me, but recovered himself, and said, &ldquo;How de do, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, sir?&rdquo; returned my guardian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir, I am tolerable,&rdquo; returned Mr. Guppy. &ldquo;Will you allow me to introduce my mother, Mrs. Guppy of the Old Street Road, and my particular friend, Mr. Weevle. That is to say, my friend has gone by the name of Weevle, but his name is really and truly Jobling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My guardian begged them to be seated, and they all sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tony,&rdquo; said Mr. Guppy to his friend, after an awkward silence. &ldquo;Will you open the case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do it yourself,&rdquo; returned the friend, rather tartly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Jarndyce, sir,&rdquo; Mr. Guppy, after a moment's consideration, began; to the great diversion of his mother, which she displayed by nudging Mr. Jobling with her elbow, and winking at me in a most remarkable manner; &ldquo;I had an idea that I should see Miss Summerson by herself, and was not quite prepared for your esteemed presence. But Miss Summerson has mentioned to you, perhaps, that something has passed between us on former occasions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Summerson,&rdquo; returned my guardian smiling, &ldquo;has made a communication to that effect to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Mr. Guppy, &ldquo;makes matters easier. Sir, I have come out of my articles at Kenge and Carboy's, and I believe with satisfaction to all parties. I am now admitted (after undergoing an examination that's enough to badger a man blue, touching a pack of nonsense that he don't want to know) on the roll of attornies, and have taken out my certificate, if it would be any satisfaction to you to see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Guppy,&rdquo; returned my guardian. &ldquo;I am quite willing&mdash;I believe I use a legal phrase&mdash;to admit the certificate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Guppy therefore desisted from taking something out of his pocket, and proceeded without it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no capital myself, but my mother has a little property which takes the form of an annuity;&rdquo; here Mr. Guppy's mother rolled her head as if she never could sufficiently enjoy the observation, and put her handkerchief to her mouth, and again winked at me; &ldquo;and a few pounds for expences out of pocket in conducting business, will never be wanting, free of interest. Which is an advantage, you know,&rdquo; said Mr. Guppy, feelingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly an advantage,&rdquo; returned my guardian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <hi rend="italics">have</hi> some connexion,&rdquo; pursued Mr. Guppy, &ldquo;and it lays in the
<pb n="612" id="p612"/>
direction of Walcot Square, Lambeth. I have therefore taken a ouse in that locality, which, in the opinion of my friends, is a hollow bargain (taxes ridiculous, and use of fixtures included in the rent), and intend setting up professionally for myself there, forthwith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Mr. Guppy's mother fell into an extraordinary passion of rolling her head, and smiling waggishly at anybody who would look at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's a six roomer, exclusive of kitchens,&rdquo; said Mr. Guppy, &ldquo;and in the opinion of my friends, a commodious tenement. When I mention my friends, I refer principally to my friend Jobling, who I believe has known me,&rdquo; Mr. Guppy looked at him with a sentimental air, &ldquo;from boyhood's hour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Jobling confirmed this, with a sliding movement of his legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend Jobling will render me his assistance in the capacity of clerk, and will live in the ouse,&rdquo; said Mr. Guppy. &ldquo;My mother will likewise live in the ouse, when her present quarter in the Old Street Road shall have ceased and expired; and consequently there will be no want of society. My friend Jobling is naturally aristocratic by taste; and besides being acquainted with the movements of the upper circles, fully backs me in the intentions I am now developing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Jobling said &ldquo;certainly,&rdquo; and withdrew a little from the elbow of Mr. Guppy's mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I have no occasion to mention to you, sir, you being in the confidence of Miss Summerson,&rdquo; said Mr. Guppy &ldquo;(mother, I wish you'd be so good as to keep still), that Miss Summerson's image was formerly imprinted on my art, and that I made her a proposal of marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I have heard,&rdquo; returned my guardian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Circumstances,&rdquo; pursued Mr. Guppy, &ldquo;over which I had no control, but quite the contrary, weakened the impression of that image for a time. At which time, Miss Summerson's conduct was highly genteel; I may even add, magnanimous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My guardian patted me on the shoulder, and seemed much amused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Guppy, &ldquo;I have got into that state of mind myself, that I wish for a reciprocity of magnanimous behaviour. I wish to prove to Miss Summerson that I can rise to a heighth, of which perhaps she hardly thought me capable. I find that the image which I did suppose had been eradicated from my art, is <hi rend="italics">not</hi> eradicated. Its influence over me is still tremenjous; and yielding to it I am willing to overlook the circumstances over which none of us have had any control, and to renew those proposals to Miss Summerson which I had the honor to make at a former period. I beg to lay the ouse in Walcot Square, the business, and myself, before Miss Summerson for her acceptance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very magnanimous, indeed, sir,&rdquo; observed my guardian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; returned Mr. Guppy, with candor, &ldquo;my wish is to <hi rend="italics">be</hi> magnanimous. I do not consider that in making this offer to Miss Summerson, I am by any means throwing myself away; neither is that the opinion of my friends. Still there are circumstances which I submit may be taken into account as a set-off against any little drawbacks of mine, and so a fair and equitable balance arrived at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take upon myself, sir,&rdquo; said my guardian, laughing as he rang the bell, &ldquo;to reply to your proposals on behalf of Miss Summerson. She is
<pb n="613" id="p613"/>
very sensible of your handsome intentions, and wishes you good evening, and wishes you well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Mr. Guppy, with a blank look. &ldquo;Is that tantamount, sir, to acceptance, or rejection, or consideration?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To decided rejection, if you please,&rdquo; returned my guardian.</p>
<p>Mr. Guppy looked incredulously at his friend, and at his mother who suddenly turned very angry, and at the floor, and at the ceiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Then, Jobling, if you was the friend you represent yourself, I should think you might hand my mother out of the gangway, instead of allowing her to remain where she ain't wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Mrs. Guppy positively refused to come out of the gangway. She wouldn't hear of it. &ldquo;Why, get along with you,&rdquo; said she to my guardian, &ldquo;what do you mean? Ain't my son good enough for you? You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Get out with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My good lady,&rdquo; returned my guardian, &ldquo;it is hardly reasonable to ask me to get out of my own room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't care for that,&rdquo; said Mrs. Guppy. &ldquo;Get out with you. If we ain't good enough for you, go and procure somebody that is good enough. Go along and find 'em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was quite unprepared for the rapid manner in which Mrs. Guppy's power of jocularity merged into a power of taking the profoundest offence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go along and find somebody that's good enough for you,&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Guppy. &ldquo;Get out!&rdquo; Nothing seemed to astonish Mr. Guppy's mother so much, and to make her so very indignant, as our not getting out. &ldquo;Why don't you get out?&rdquo; said Mrs. Guppy. &ldquo;What are you stopping here for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; interposed her son, always getting before her, and pushing her back with one shoulder, as she sidled at my guardian, &ldquo;<hi rend="italics">will</hi> you hold your tongue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, William,&rdquo; she returned; &ldquo;I won't! Not unless he gets out, I won't!&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, Mr. Guppy and Mr. Jobling together closed on Mr. Guppy's mother (who began to be quite abusive), and took her, very much against her will, down-stairs; her voice rising a stair higher every time her figure got a stair lower, and insisting that we should immediately go and find somebody who was good enough for us, and above all things that we should get out.</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER LXV.<lb/> BEGINNING THE WORLD.</head>
<p>THE Term had commenced, and my guardian found an intimation from Mr. Kenge that the Cause would come on in two days. As I had sufficient hopes of the will to be in a flutter about it, Allan and I agreed to go down to the Court that morning. Richard was extremely agitated, and was so weak and low, though his illness was still of the mind, that my dear girl indeed had sore occasion to be supported. But she looked
<pb n="614" id="p614"/>
forward&mdash;a very little way now&mdash;to the help that was to come to her, and never drooped.</p>
<p>It was at Westminster that the Cause was to come on. It had come on there, I dare say, a hundred times before, but I could not divest myself of an idea that it <hi rend="italics">might</hi> lead to some result now. We left home directly after breakfast, to be at Westminster Hall in good time; and walked down there through the lively streets&mdash;so happily and strangely it seemed!&mdash;together.</p>
<p>As we were going along, planning what we should do for Richard and Ada, I heard somebody calling &ldquo;Esther! My dear Esther! Esther!&rdquo; And there was Caddy Jellyby, with her head out of the window of a little carriage which she hired now to go about in to her pupils (she had so many), as if she wanted to embrace me at a hundred yards' distance. I had written her a note to tell her of all that my guardian had done, but had not had a moment to go and see her. Of course we turned back; and the affectionate girl was in that state of rapture, and was so overjoyed to talk about the night when she brought me the flowers, and was so determined to squeeze my face (bonnet and all) between her hands, and go on in a wild manner altogether, calling me all kinds of precious names, and telling Allan I had done I don't know what for her, that I was just obliged to get into the little carriage and calm her down, by letting her say and do exactly what she liked. Allan, standing at the window, was as pleased as Caddy; and I was as pleased as either of them; and I wonder that I got away as I did, rather than that I came off, laughing, and red, and anything but tidy, and looking after Caddy, who looked after us out of the coach-window as long as she could see us.</p>
<p>This made us some quarter of an hour late, and when we came to Westminster Hall we found that the day's business was begun. Worse than that, we found such an unusual crowd in the Court of Chancery that it was full to the door, and we could neither see nor hear what was passing within. It appeared to be something droll, for occasionally there was a laugh, and a cry of &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; It appeared to be something interesting, for every one was pushing and striving to get nearer. It appeared to be something that made the professional gentlemen very merry, for there were several young counsellors in wigs and whiskers on the outside of the crowd, and when one of them told the others about it, they put their hands in their pockets, and quite doubled themselves up with laughter, and went stamping about the pavement of the hall.</p>
<p>We asked a gentleman by us, if he knew what cause was on? He told us Jarndyce and Jarndyce. We asked him if he knew what was doing in it? He said, really no he did not, nobody ever did; but as well as he could make out, it was over. Over for the day? we asked him. No, he said; over for good.</p>
<p>Over for good!</p>
<p>When we heard this unaccountable answer, we looked at one another quite lost in amazement. Could it be possible that the Will had set things right at last, and that Richard and Ada were going to be rich? It seemed too good to be true. Alas it was!</p>
<p>Our suspense was short; for a break up soon took place in the crowd, and the people came streaming out looking flushed and hot, and bringing
<pb n="615" id="p615"/>
a quantity of bad air with them. Still they were all exceedingly amused, and were more like people coming out from a Farce or a Juggler than from a court of Justice. We stood aside, watching for any countenance we knew; and presently great bundles of papers began to be carried out&mdash;bundles in bags, bundles too large to be got into any bags, immense masses of papers of all shapes and no shapes, which the bearers staggered under, and threw down for the time being, anyhow, on the Hall pavement, while they went back to bring out more. Even these clerks were laughing. We glanced at the papers, and seeing Jarndyce and Jarndyce everywhere, asked an official-looking person who was standing in the midst of them, whether the cause was over. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it was all up with it at last!&rdquo; and burst out laughing too.</p>
<p>At this juncture, we perceived Mr. Kenge coming out of court with an affable dignity upon him, listening to Mr. Vholes, who was deferential, and carried his own bag. Mr. Vholes was the first to see us. &ldquo;Here is Miss Summerson, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And Mr. Woodcourt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O indeed! Yes. Truly!&rdquo; said Mr. Kenge, raising his hat to me with polished politeness. &ldquo;How do you do? Glad to see you. Mr. Jarndyce is not here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No. He never came there, I reminded him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really,&rdquo; returned Mr. Kenge, &ldquo;it is as well that he is <hi rend="italics">not</hi> here to-day, for his&mdash;shall I say, in my good friend's absence, his indomitable singularity of opinion?&mdash;might have been strengthened, perhaps; not reasonably, but might have been strengthened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray what has been done to-day?&rdquo; asked Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon?&rdquo; said Mr. Kenge, with excessive urbanity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has been done to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has been done,&rdquo; repeated Mr. Kenge. &ldquo;Quite so. Yes. Why, not much has been done; not much. We have been checked&mdash;brought up suddenly, I would say&mdash;upon the&mdash;shall I term it threshold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this Will considered a genuine document, sir?&rdquo; said Allan; &ldquo;will you tell us that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most certainly, if I could,&rdquo; said Mr. Kenge; &ldquo;but we have not gone into that, we have not gone into that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have not gone into that,&rdquo; repeated Mr. Vholes, as if his low inward voice were an echo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are to reflect, Mr. Woodcourt,&rdquo; observed Mr. Kenge, using his silver trowel, persuasively and smoothingly, &ldquo;that this has been a great cause, that this has been a protracted cause, that this has been a complex cause. Jarndyce and Jarndyce has been termed, not inaptly, a Monument of Chancery practice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Patience has sat upon it a long time,&rdquo; said Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well indeed, sir,&rdquo; returned Mr. Kenge, with a certain condescending laugh he had. &ldquo;Very well! You are further to reflect, Mr. Woodcourt,&rdquo; becoming dignified to severity, &ldquo;that on the numerous difficulties, contingencies, masterly fictions, and forms of procedure in this great cause, there has been expended study, ability, eloquence, knowledge, intellect, Mr. Woodcourt, high intellect. For many years, the&mdash;a&mdash;I would say the flower of the Bar, and the&mdash;a&mdash;I would presume to add, the matured autumnal fruits of the Woolsack&mdash;have been lavished upon Jarndyce and Jarndyce. If the public have the
<pb n="616" id="p616"/>
benefit, and if the country have the adornment, of this great Grasp, it must be paid for, in money or money's worth, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Kenge,&rdquo; said Allan, appearing enlightened all in a moment. &ldquo;Excuse me, our time presses. Do I understand that the whole estate is found to have been absorbed in costs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hem! I believe so,&rdquo; returned Mr. Kenge. &ldquo;Mr. Vholes, what do <hi rend="italics">you</hi> say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe so,&rdquo; said Mr. Vholes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that thus the suit lapses and melts away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably,&rdquo; returned Mr. Kenge. &ldquo;Mr. Vholes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably,&rdquo; said Mr. Vholes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dearest life,&rdquo; whispered Allan, &ldquo;this will break Richard's heart!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was such a shock of apprehension in his face, and he knew Richard so perfectly, and I too had seen so much of his gradual decay, that what my dear girl had said to me in the fulness of her foreboding love, sounded like a knell in my ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In case you should be wanting Mr. C, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Vholes, coming after us, &ldquo;you'll find him in court. I left him there resting himself a little. Good day, sir; good day, Miss Summerson.&rdquo; As he gave me that slowly devouring look of his, while twisting up the strings of his bag, before he hastened with it after Mr. Kenge, the benignant shadow of whose conversational presence he seemed afraid to leave, he gave one gasp as if he had swallowed the last morsel of this client, and his black buttoned-up unwholesome figure glided away to the low door at the end of the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear love,&rdquo; said Allan, &ldquo;leave to me, for a little while, the charge you gave me. Go home with this intelligence, and come to Ada's by-and-by!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I would not let him take me to a coach, but entreated him to go to Richard without a moment's delay, and leave me to do as he wished. Hurrying home, I found my guardian, and told him gradually with what news I had returned. &ldquo;Little woman,&rdquo; said he, quite unmoved for himself, &ldquo;to have done with the suit on any terms, is a greater blessing than I had looked for. But my poor young cousins!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We talked about them all the morning, and discussed what it was possible to do. In the afternoon, my guardian walked with me to Symond's Inn, and left me at the door. I went up-stairs. When my darling heard my footsteps, she came out into the small passage and threw her arms round my neck; but she composed herself directly, and said that Richard had asked for me several times. Allan had found him sitting in a corner of the court, she told me, like a stone figure. On being roused, he had broken away, and made as if he would have spoken in a fierce voice to the judge. He was stopped by his mouth being full of blood, and Allan had brought him home.</p>
<p>He was lying on the sofa with his eyes closed, when I went in. There were restoratives on the table; the room was made as airy as possible, and was darkened, and was very orderly and quiet. Allan stood behind him, watching him gravely. His face appeared to me to be quite destitute of color, and, now that I saw him without his seeing me, I fully saw, for the first time, how worn away he was. But he looked handsomer than I had seen him look for many a day.</p>
<pb n="617" id="p617"/>
<p>I sat down by his side in silence. Opening his eyes by-and-by, he said, in a weak voice but with his old smile, &ldquo;Dame Durden, kiss me, my dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a great comfort and surprise to me, to find him in his low state cheerful and looking forward. He was happier, he said, in our intended marriage, than he could find words to tell me. My husband had been a guardian angel to him and Ada, and he blessed us both, and wished us all the joy that life could yield us. I almost felt as if my own heart would have broken, when I saw him take my husband's hand and hold it to his breast.</p>
<p>We spoke of the future as much as possible, and he said several times that he must be present at our marriage if he could stand upon his feet. Ada would contrive to take him, somehow, he said. &ldquo;Yes, surely, dearest Richard!&rdquo; But as my darling answered him thus hopefully, so serene and beautiful, with the help that was to come to her so near,&mdash;I knew&mdash;I knew!</p>
<p>It was not good for him to talk too much; and when he was silent, we were silent too. Sitting beside him, I made a pretence of working for my dear, as he had always been used to joke about my being busy. Ada leaned upon his pillow, holding his head upon her arm. He dozed often; and whenever he awoke without seeing him, said, first of all, &ldquo;Where is Woodcourt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evening had come on, when I lifted up my eyes, and saw my guardian standing in the little hall. &ldquo;Who is that, Dame Durden?&rdquo; Richard asked me. The door was behind him, but he had observed in my face that some one was there.</p>
<p>I looked to Allan for advice, and as he nodded &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; bent over Richard and told him. My guardian saw what passed, came softly by me in a moment, and laid his hand on Richard's. &ldquo;O sir,&rdquo; said Richard, &ldquo;you are a good man, you are a good man!&rdquo; and burst into tears for the first time.</p>
<p>My guardian, the picture of a good man, sat down in my place, keeping his hand on Richard's.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Rick,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the clouds have cleared away, and it is bright now. We can see now. We were all bewildered, Rick, more or less. What matters! And how are you, my dear boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very weak, sir, but I hope I shall be stronger. I have to begin the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, truly; well said!&rdquo; cried my guardian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not begin it in the old way now,&rdquo; said Richard with a sad smile. &ldquo;I have learned a lesson now, sir. It was a hard one; but you shall be assured, indeed, that I have learned it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said my guardian, comforting him; &ldquo;well, well, well, dear boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking, sir,&rdquo; resumed Richard, &ldquo;that there is nothing on earth I should so much like to see as their house&mdash;Dame Durden's and Woodcourt's house. If I could be moved there when I begin to recover my strength, I feel as if I should get well there, sooner than anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, so have I been thinking, too, Rick,&rdquo; said my guardian, &ldquo;and our little woman likewise; she and I have been talking of it, this very day. I dare say her husband won't object. What do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<pb n="618" id="p618"/>
<p>Richard smiled; and lifted up his arm to touch him, as he stood behind the head of his couch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say nothing of Ada,&rdquo; said Richard, &ldquo;but I think of her, and have thought of her very much. Look at her! see her here, sir, bending over this pillow when she has so much need to rest upon it herself, my dear love, my poor girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He clasped her in his arms, and none of us spoke. He gradually released her; and she looked upon us, and looked up to Heaven, and moved her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I get down to Bleak House,&rdquo; said Richard, &ldquo;I shall have much to tell you, sir, and you will have much to show me. You will go, won't you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly, dear Rick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you; like you, like you,&rdquo; said Richard. &ldquo;But it's all like you. They have been telling me how you planned it, and how you remembered all Esther's familiar tastes and ways. It will be like coming to the old Bleak House again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you will come there too, I hope, Rick. I am a solitary man now, you know, and it will be a charity to come to me. A charity to come to me, my love!&rdquo; he repeated to Ada, as he gently passed his hand over her golden hair, and put a lock of it to his lips. (I think he vowed within himself to cherish her if she were left alone.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was all a troubled dream?&rdquo; said Richard, clasping both my guardian's hands eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing more, Rick; nothing more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, being a good man, can pass it as such, and forgive and pity the dreamer, and be lenient and encouraging when he wakes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I can. What am I but another dreamer, Rick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will begin the world!&rdquo; said Richard, with a light in his eyes.</p>
<p>My husband drew a little nearer towards Ada, and I saw him solemnly lift up his hand to warn my guardian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When shall I go from this place, to that pleasant country where the old times are, where I shall have strength to tell what Ada has been to me, where I shall be able to recall my many faults and blindnesses, where I shall prepare myself to be a guide to my unborn child?&rdquo; said Richard. &ldquo;When shall I go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Rick, when you are strong enough,&rdquo; returned my guardian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ada, my darling!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sought to raise himself a little. Allan raised him so that she could hold him on her bosom: which was what he wanted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have done you many wrongs, my own. I have fallen like a poor stray shadow on your way, I have married you to poverty and trouble, I have scattered your means to the winds. You will forgive me all this, my Ada, before I begin the world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A smile irradiated his face, as she bent to kiss him. He slowly laid his face down upon her bosom, drew his arms closer round her neck, and with one parting sob began the world. Not this world, O not this! The world that sets this right.</p>
<p>When all was still, at a late hour, poor crazed Miss Flite came weeping to me, and told me that she had given her birds their liberty.</p>

<head>CHAPTER LXVI. <lb/> DOWN IN LINCOLNSHIRE.</head>
<p>THERE is a hush upon Chesney Wold in these altered days, as there is upon a portion of the family history. The story goes, that Sir Leicester paid some who could have spoken out, to hold their peace; but it is a lame story, feebly whispering and creeping about, and any brighter spark of life it shows soon dies away. It is known for certain that the handsome Lady Dedlock lies in the mausoleum in the park, where the trees arch darkly overhead, and the owl is heard at night making the woods ring; but whence she was brought home, to be laid among the echoes of that solitary place, or how she died, is all mystery. Some of her old friends, principally to be found among the peachy-cheeked charmers with the skeleton throats, did once occasionally say, as they toyed in a ghastly manner with large fans&mdash;like charmers reduced to flirting with grim Death, after losing all their other beaux&mdash;did once occasionally say, when the World assembled together, that they wondered the ashes of the Dedlocks, entombed in the mausoleum, never rose against the profanation of her company. But the dead-and-gone Dedlocks take it very calmly, and have never been known to object.</p>
<p>Up from among the fern in the hollow, and winding by the bridle-road among the trees, comes sometimes to this lonely spot the sound of horses' hoofs. Then may be seen Sir Leicester&mdash;invalided, bent, and almost blind, but of a worthy presence yet&mdash;riding with a stalwart man beside him, constant to his bridle-rein. When they come to a certain spot before the mausoleum door, Sir Leicester's accustomed horse stops of his own accord, and Sir Leicester, pulling off his hat, is still for a few moments before they ride away.</p>
<p>War rages yet with the audacious Boythorn, though at uncertain intervals, and now hotly, and now coolly; flickering like an unsteady fire. The truth is said to be, that when Sir Leicester came down to Lincolnshire for good, Mr. Boythorn showed a manifest desire to abandon his right of way, and do whatever Sir Leicester would: which Sir Leicester, conceiving to be a concession to his illness or misfortune, took in such high dudgeon, and was so magnificently aggrieved by, that Mr. Boythorn found himself under the necessity of committing a flagrant trespass to restore his neighbour to himself. Similarly Mr. Boythorn continues to post tremendous placards on the disputed thoroughfare, and (with his bird upon his head) to hold forth vehemently against Sir Leicester in the sanctuary of his own home; similarly, also, he defies him as of old in the little church, by testifying a bland unconsciousness of his existence. But it is whispered that when he is most ferocious towards his old foe, he is really most considerate; and that Sir Leicester, in the dignity of being implacable, little supposes how much he is humoured. As little does he think how near together he and his antagonist have suffered, in the fortunes of two sisters; and his antagonist, who knows it now, is
<pb n="620" id="p620"/>
not the man to tell him. So the quarrel goes on, to the satisfaction of both.</p>
<p>In one of the lodges of the Park; that lodge within sight of the house where, once upon a time, when the waters were out down in Lincolnshire, my Lady used to see the Keeper's child; the stalwart man, the trooper formerly, is housed. Some relies of his old calling hang upon the walls, and these it is the chosen recreation of a little lame man about the stable-yard to keep gleaming bright. A busy little man he always is, in the polishing at harness-house doors, of stirrup-irons, bits, curb-chains, harness-bosses, anything in the way of a stable-yard that will take a polish: leading a life of friction. A shaggy little damaged man, withal, not unlike an old dog of some mongrel breed, who has been considerably knocked about. He answers to the name of Phil.</p>
<p>A goodly sight it is to see the grand old housekeeper (harder of hearing now) going to church on the arm of her son, and to observe&mdash;which few do, for the house is scant of company in these times&mdash;the relations of both towards Sir Leicester, and his towards them. They have visitors in the high summer weather, when a grey cloak and umbrella, unknown to Chesney Wold at other periods, are seen among the leaves; when two young ladies are occasionally found gambolling, in sequestered sawpits and such nooks of the park; and when the smoke of two pipes wreathes away into the fragrant evening air, from the trooper's door. Then is a fife heard trolling within the lodge, on the inspiring topic of the British Grenadiers; and, as the evening closes in, a gruff inflexible voice is heard to say, while two men pace together up and down, &ldquo;But I never own to it before the old girl. Discipline must be maintained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The greater part of the house is shut up, and it is a show-house no longer; yet Sir Leicester holds his shrunken state in the long drawing-room for all that, and reposes in his old place before my Lady's picture. Closed in by night with broad screens, and illumined only in that part, the light of the drawing-room seems gradually contracting and dwindling until it shall be no more. A little more, in truth, and it will be all extinguished for Sir Leicester; and the damp door in the mausoleum which shuts so tight, and looks so obdurate, will have opened and relieved him.</p>
<p>Volumnia, growing with the flight of time pinker as to the red in her face and yellower as to the white, reads to Sir Leicester in the long evenings, and is driven to various artifices to conceal her yawns: of which the chief and most efficacious is the insertion of the pearl necklace between her rosy lips. Long-winded treatises on the Buffy and Boodle question, showing how Buffy is immaculate and Boodle villainous, and how the country is lost by being all Boodle and no Buffy, or saved by being all Buffy and no Boodle (it must be one of the two, and cannot be anything else), are the staple of her reading. Sir Leicester is not particular what it is, and does not appear to follow it very closely; further than that he always comes broad awake the moment Volumnia ventures to leave off, and, sonorously repeating her last word, begs with some displeasure to know if she finds herself fatigued? However, Volumnia, in the course of her bird-like hopping about and pecking at papers, has lighted on a memorandum concerning herself, in the event of &ldquo;anything happening&rdquo; to her kinsman, which is handsome compensation
<pb n="621" id="p621"/>
for an extensive course of reading, and holds even the dragon Boredom at bay.</p>
<p>The cousins generally are rather shy of Chesney Wold in its dulness, but take to it a little in the shooting season, when guns are heard in the plantations, and a few scattered beaters and keepers wait at the old places of appointment, for low spirited twos and threes of cousins. The debilitated cousin, more debilitated by the dreariness of the place, gets into a fearful state of depression, groaning under penitential sofa-pillows in his gunless hours, and protesting that such fernal old jail's&mdash;nough t'sew fler up&mdash;frever.</p>
<p>The only great occasions for Volumnia, in this changed aspect of the place in Lincolnshire, are those occasions, rare and widely-separated, when something is to be done for the county, or the country, in the way of gracing a public ball. Then, indeed, does the tuckered sylph come out in fairy form, and proceed with joy under cousinly escort to the exhausted old assembly-room, fourteen heavy miles off; which, during three hundred and sixty-four days and nights of every ordinary year, is a kind of Antipodean lumber-room, full of old chairs and tables, upside down. Then, indeed, does she captivate all hearts by her condescension, by her girlish vivacity, and by her skipping about as in the days when the hideous old general with the mouth too full of teeth, had not cut one of them at two guineas each. Then does she twirl and twine, a pastoral nymph of good family, through the mazes of the dance. Then do the swains appear with tea, with lemonade, with sandwiches, with homage. Then is she kind and cruel, stately and unassuming, various, beautifully wilful. Then is there a singular kind of parallel between her and the little glass chandeliers of another age, embellishing that assembly-room; which, with their meagre stems, their spare little drops, their disappointing knobs where no drops are, their bare little stalks from which knobs and drops have both departed, and their little feeble prismatic twinkling, all seem Volumnias.</p>
<p>For the rest, Lincolnshire life to Volumnia is a vast blank of overgrown house looking out upon trees, sighing, wringing their hands, bowing their heads, and casting their tears upon the window-panes in monotonous depression. A labyrinth of grandeur, less the property of an old family of human beings and their ghostly likenesses, than of an old family of echoings and thunderings which start out of their hundred graves at every sound, and go resounding through the building. A waste of unused passages and staircases, in which to drop a comb upon a bed-room floor at night is to send a stealthy footfall on an errand through the house. A place where few people care to go about alone; where a maid screams if an ash drops from the fire, takes to crying at all times and seasons, becomes the victim of a low disorder of the spirits, and gives warning and departs.</p>
<p>Thus Chesney Wold. With so much of itself abandoned to darkness and vacancy; with so little change under the summer shining or the wintry lowering; so sombre and motionless always&mdash;no flag flying now by day, no rows of lights sparkling by night; with no family to come and go, no visitors to be the souls of pale cold shapes of rooms, no stir of life about it;&mdash;passion and pride, even to the stranger's eye, have died away from the place in Lincolnshire, and yielded it to dull repose.</p>

<div1 type="chapter">
<pb n="622" id="p622"/>
<head>CHAPTER LXVII. <lb/> THE CLOSE OF ESTHER'S NARRATIVE.</head>
<p>FULL seven happy years I have been the mistress of Bleak House. The few words that I have to add to what I have written, are soon penned; then I, and the unknown friend to whom I write, will part for ever. Not without much dear remembrance on my side. Not without some, I hope, on his or hers.</p>
<p>They gave my darling into my arms, and through many weeks I never left her. The little child who was to have done so much, was born before the turf was planted on its father's grave. It was a boy; and I, my husband, and my guardian, gave him his father's name.</p>
<p>The help that my dear counted on, did come to her; though it came, in the Eternal wisdom, for another purpose. Though to bless and restore his mother, not his father, was the errand of this baby, its power was mighty to do it. When I saw the strength of the weak little hand, and how its touch could heal my darling's heart, and raise up hope within her, I felt a new sense of the goodness and the tenderness of God.</p>
<p>They throve; and by degrees I saw my dear girl pass into my country garden, and walk there with her infant in her arms. I was married then. I was the happiest of the happy.</p>
<p>It was at this time that my guardian joined us, and asked Ada when she would come home?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both houses are your home, my dear,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but the older Bleak House claims priority. When you and my boy are strong enough to do it, come and take possession of your home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ada called him &ldquo;her dearest cousin, John.&rdquo; But he said, No, it must be guardian now. He was her guardian henceforth, and the boy's; and he had an old association with the name. So she called him guardian, and has called him guardian ever since. The children know him by no other name.&mdash;I say the children; I have two little daughters.</p>
<p>It is difficult to believe that Charley (round-eyed still, and not at all grammatical) is married to a miller in our neighbourhood; yet so it is; and even now, looking up from my desk as I write, early in the morning at my summer window, I see the very mill beginning to go round. I hope the miller will not spoil Charley; but he is very fond of her, and Charley is rather vain of such a match&mdash;for he is well to do, and was in great request. So far as my small maid is concerned, I might suppose Time to have stood for seven years as still as the mill did half an hour ago; since little Emma, Charley's sister, is exactly what Charley used to be. As to Tom, Charley's brother, I am really afraid to say what he did at school in cyphering, but I think it was Decimals. He is apprenticed to the miller, whatever it was; and is a good bashful fellow, always falling in love with somebody, and being ashamed of it.</p>
<p>Caddy Jellyby passed her very last holidays with us, and was a dearer creature than ever; perpetually dancing in and out of the house with the
<pb n="623" id="p623"/>
children, as if she had never given a dancing-lesson in her life. Caddy keeps her own little carriage now, instead of hiring one, and lives full two miles further westward than Newman Street. She works very hard, her husband (an excellent one) being lame, and able to do very little. Still, she is more than contented, and does all she has to do with all her heart. Mr. Jellyby spends his evenings at her new house with his head against the wall, as he used to do in her old one. I have heard that Mrs. Jellyby was understood to suffer great mortification, from her daughter's ignoble marriage and pursuits; but I hope she got over it in time. She has been disappointed in Borrioboola Gha, which turned out a failure in consequence of the King of Borrioboola wanting to sell everybody&mdash;who survived the climate&mdash;for Rum; but she has taken up with the rights of women to sit in Parliament, and Caddy tells me it is a mission involving more correspondence than the old one. I had almost forgotten Caddy's poor little girl. She is not such a mite now; but she is deaf and dumb. I believe there never was a better mother than Caddy, who learns, in her scanty intervals of leisure, innumerable deaf and dumb arts, to soften the affliction of her child.</p>
<p>As if I were never to have done with Caddy, I am reminded here of Peepy and old Mr. Turveydrop. Peepy is in the Custom-house, and doing extremely well. Old Mr. Turveydrop, very apoplectic, still exhibits his Deportment about town; still enjoys himself in the old manner; is still believed in, in the old way. He is constant in his patronage of Peepy, and is understood to have bequeathed him a favorite French clock in his dressing-room&mdash;which is not his property.</p>
<p>With the first money we saved at home, we added to our pretty house by throwing out a little Growlery expressly for my guardian; which we inaugurated with great splendour the next time he came down to see us. I try to write all this lightly, because my heart is full in drawing to an end; but when I write of him, my tears will have their way.</p>
<p>I never look at him, but I hear our poor dear Richard calling him a good man. To Ada and her pretty boy, he is the fondest father; to me, he is what he has ever been, and what name can I give to that! He is my husband's best and dearest friend, he is our children's darling, he is the object of our deepest love and veneration. Yet while I feel towards him as if he were a superior being, I am so familiar with him, and so easy with him, that I almost wonder at myself. I have never lost my old names, nor has he lost his; nor do I ever, when he is with us, sit in any other place than in my old chair at his side. Dame Trot, Dame Durden, Little Woman!&mdash;all just the same as ever; and I answer, Yes, dear guardian!&mdash;just the same.</p>
<p>I have never known the wind to be in the East for a single moment, since the day when he took me to the porch to read the name. I remarked to him, once, that the wind seemed never in the East now: and he said, No, truly; it had finally departed from that quarter on that very day.</p>
<p>I think my darling girl is more beautiful than ever. The sorrow that has been in her face&mdash;for it is not there now&mdash;seems to have purified even its innocent expression, and to have given it a diviner quality. Sometimes, when I raise my eyes and see her, in the black dress that she still wears, teaching my Richard, I feel&mdash;it is difficult to express&mdash;
<pb n="624" id="p624"/>
as if it were so good to know that she remembers her dear Esther in her prayers.</p>
<p>I call him my Richard! But he says that he has two mamas, and I am one.</p>
<p>We are not rich in the bank, but we have always prospered, and we have quite enough. I never walk out with my husband, but I hear the people bless him. I never go into a house of any degree, but I hear his praises, or see them in grateful eyes. I never lie down at night, but I know that in the course of that day he has alleviated pain, and soothed some fellow-creature in the time of need. I know that from the beds of those who were past recovery, thanks have often, often gone up, in the last hour, for his patient ministration. Is not this to be rich?</p>
<p>The people even praise Me as the doctor's wife. The people even like Me as I go about, and make so much of me that I am quite abashed. I owe it all to him, my love, my pride! They like me for his sake, as I do everything I do in life for his sake.</p>
<p>A night or two ago, after bustling about preparing for my darling and my guardian and little Richard, who are coming to-morrow, I was sitting out in the porch of all places, that dearly memorable porch, when Allan came home. So he said, &ldquo;My precious little woman, what are you doing here?&rdquo; And I said, &ldquo;The moon is shining so brightly, Allan, and the night is so delicious, that I have been sitting here, thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you been thinking about, my dear?&rdquo; said Allan then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How curious you are!&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I am almost ashamed to tell you, but I will. I have been thinking about my old looks&mdash;such as they were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what have you been thinking about <hi rend="italics">them,</hi> my busy bee?&rdquo; said Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been thinking, that I thought it was impossible that you <hi rend="italics">could</hi> have loved me any better, even if I had retained them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;Such as they were?&rdquo; said Allan, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such as they were, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Dame Durden,&rdquo; said Allan, drawing my arm through his, &ldquo;do you ever look in the glass?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know I do; you see me do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And don't you know that you are prettier than you ever were?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not know that; I am not certain that I know it now. But I know that my dearest little pets are very pretty, and that my darling is very beautiful, and that my husband is very handsome, and that my guardian has the brightest and most benevolent face that ever was seen; and that they can very well do without much beauty in me&mdash;even supposing&mdash;.</p>

<head>PREFACE.</head>
<p>A FEW months ago, on a public occasion, a Chancery Judge had the kindness to inform me, as one of a company of some hundred and fifty men and women not laboring under any suspicions of lunacy, that the Court of Chancery, though the shining subject of much popular prejudice (at which point I thought the Judge's eye had a cast in my direction), was almost immaculate. There had been, he admitted, a trivial blemish or so in its rate of progress, but this was exaggerated, and had been entirely owing to the &ldquo;parsimony of the public;&rdquo; which guilty public, it appeared, had been until lately bent in the most determined manner on by no means enlarging the number of Chancery Judges appointed&mdash;I believe by Richard the Second, but any other King will do as well.</p>
<p>This seemed to me too profound a joke to be inserted in the body of this book, or I should have restored it to Conversation Kenge or to Mr. Vholes, with one or other of whom I think it must have originated. In such mouths I might have
<pb n="viii" id="pviii"/>
coupled it with an apt quotation from one of SHAKSPEARE'S Sonnets:
<q><lg type="poem">
<l>My nature is subdued</l>
<l>To what it works in, like the dyer's hand:</l>
<l>Pity me then, and wish I were renew'd!</l>
</lg></q>
</p>

<p>But as it is wholesome that the parsimonious public should know what has been doing, and still is doing, in this connexion, I mention here that everything set forth in these pages concerning the Court of Chancery is substantially true, and within the truth. The case of Gridley is in no essential altered from one of actual occurrence, made public by a disinterested person who was professionally acquainted with the whole of the monstrous wrong from beginning to end. At the present moment there is a suit before the Court which was commenced nearly twenty years ago; in which from thirty to forty counsel have been known to appear at one time; in which costs have been incurred to the amount of seventy thousand pounds; which is <hi rend="italics">a friendly suit;</hi> and which is (I am assured) no nearer to its termination now than when it was begun. There is another well-known suit in Chancery, not yet decided, which was commenced before the close of the last century, and in which more than double the amount of seventy thousand pounds has been swallowed up in costs. If I wanted other authorities for JARNDYCE AND JARNDYCE, I could rain them on these pages, to the shame of&mdash;a parsimonious public.</p>
<p>There is only one other point on which I offer a word of remark. The possibility of what is called Spontaneous Combustion has been denied since the death of Mr. Krook;
<pb n="ix" id="pix"/>
and my good friend MR. LEWES (quite mistaken, as he soon found, in supposing the thing to have been abandoned by all authorities) published some ingenious letters to me at the time when that event was chronicled, arguing that Spontaneous Combustion could not possibly be. I have no need to observe that I do not wilfully or negligently mislead my readers, and that before I wrote that description I took pains to investigate the subject. There are about thirty cases on record, of which the most famous, that of the Countess Cornelia de Bandi Cesenate was minutely investigated and described by Giuseppe Bianchini, a prebendary of Verona, otherwise distinguished in letters, who published an account of it at Verona, in 1731, which he afterwards republished at Rome. The appearances beyond all rational doubt observed in that case, are the appearances observed in Mr. Krook's case. The next most famous instance happened at Rheims, six years earlier; and the historian in that case is LE CAT, one of the most renowned surgeons produced by France. The subject was a woman, whose husband was ignorantly convicted of having murdered her; but, on solemn appeal to a higher court, he was acquitted, because it was shown upon the evidence that she had died the death to which this name of Spontaneous Combustion is given. I do not think it necessary to add to these notable facts, and that general reference to the authorities which will be found at page 329, the recorded opinions and experiences of distinguished medical professors, French, English, and Scotch, in more modern days; contenting myself with observing, that I shall not abandon the facts until there shall have been a considerable
<pb n="x" id="px"/>
Spontaneous Combustion of the testimony on which human occurrences are usually received.</p>
<p>In Bleak House, I have purposely dwelt upon the romantic side of familiar things. I believe I have never had so many readers as in this book. May we meet again!</p>

<p>FOR <lb/> PURIFYING WATER, <lb/> Manufactured in the Patent Stone which has obtained the Medal of the Society of Civil Engineers, the Medal of the Great Exhibition of 1851, the approval of the most distinguished Men of Science, as Faraday, De la Beche, Buckland, Cubitt, Ansted, Phillips, &amp;c. &amp;c., of the most eminent Men in the Medical Profession, and of the leading Journalists whose Testimonials are annexed.</p>
<p>
<table rows="8" cols="2">
<head>The Advantages of the Patent Stone Filter are,&mdash;</head>
<row>
<cell> 1st. </cell>
<cell> Simplicity of construction, and a never-failing supply of water. </cell>
</row>
<row>
<cell> 2nd. </cell>
<cell> The purity of the filtered water, arising from the thickness and density of the stone through which it passes. </cell>
</row>
<row>
<cell> 3rd. </cell>
<cell> Coolness of the water in summer; the apparatus, being completely immersed, is not liable to be affected by atmospheric temperature. </cell>
</row>
<row>
<cell> 4th. </cell>
<cell> It is equally applicable to Wells, Ponds, or large Reservoirs, as to the common Cistern or Water-butt. </cell>
</row>
<row>
<cell> 5th. </cell>
<cell> The water thus filtered is freed from the insipid flatness peculiar to that passing through the ordinary filters. </cell>
</row>
<row>
<cell> 6th. </cell>
<cell> Its cheapness over other filters, when estimated by the amount of water it is capable of filtering. </cell>
</row>
<row>
<cell> 7th. </cell>
<cell> It is eminently adapted for the filtration of other liquids, which it renders fine and transparent, without depriving them of their essential properties, or exposing them to the action of the atmosphere, as is the case with most other filters. </cell>
</row>
<row>
<cell> 8th. </cell>
<cell> The absence of Sponge or any other matter liable to decomposition or decay. Experience has proved that the ordinary filters after a short space of time frequently render the water more disagreeable and impure than before, owing to the putrid state of the very medium that is used for filtration. </cell>

<head>RANSOME'S PATENT STONE FILTERS <lb/> FOR <lb/> PURIFYING WATER, &amp;c.</head>
<div2 type="section">
<head>INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.</head>
<p>ABUNDANT evidence exists, from history, that the ancients were fully aware of the great importance of using Pure Water. One circumstance alone&mdash;viz., the construction, at an enormous expense, of their magnificent Aqueducts&mdash;sufficiently attests the fact. We find likewise in old writings, that the vigour and florid appearance of the inhabitants, and healthiness of the animals living in a neighbourhood, were considered as depending greatly on the good quality of the water made use of; and that the pale and unhealthy appearance of <hi rend="italics">goitre,</hi> or swellings of the neck, and other signs of disease, were ascribed to the use of unwholesome water. In our own times, also, we have no lack of evidence tending to show, most unequivocally, the value of having the water made use of for domestic purposes of the purest quality. Every one who has travelled in the Low Countries of Holland and Belgium, must be aware that the use of the water to those unaccustomed to it quickly gives rise to affections of the bowels, and to such an extent is this the case, that our guide-books warn travellers not to partake of it. The same applies to water derived from Marshy sources in our own country; and doubtless much of the <hi rend="italics">epidemic diarrhoea</hi> so common in Great Britain and other countries in summer and autumnal months, may with justice be ascribed to the increased impurities of water at such seasons, caused by the heat of the weather. Not only does the use of Impure water give rise to diseases of a slight character, and such as are slow in their action, but during the prevalence of different epidemics the liability to be affected appears to be very considerably influenced by the quality of the water made use of. This is shown by Dr. Snow in his pamphlet, &ldquo;On the Mode of Communication of <hi rend="italics">Cholera;</hi>&rdquo; and to show that such is not merely an individual opinion, we need only refer for confirmation of the fact to the Report of the General <hi rend="italics">Board of Health,</hi> on the <hi rend="italics">Epidemic Cholera,</hi> of 1848-49, where the following passage occurs:&mdash;&ldquo;During the late epidemic, much additional evidence has been elicited, proving the influence of the use of Impure water in predisposing to the disease. There has been scarcely a town in the kingdom in which cholera has been prevalent, that has not afforded some instance of it; and where the water has been contaminated by the contents of sewers or privies, or by the drainage of graveyards, the seizures have been more sudden and violent, and the proportion of deaths to attacks greater even than from overcrowding.&rdquo; Many cases are given as confirmations of the truth of this assertion, and proved to apply not only to cholera, but to <hi rend="italics">typhus</hi> and malignant <hi rend="italics">scarlet fever, agues,</hi> and other <hi rend="italics">fatal diseases.</hi> The accounts of long voyages not unfrequently give striking evidence of the terrible effects of Impure water made use of on board ships, arising from the decomposition of animal and vegetable matters contained in it, all of which may be effectually removed by very simple means. Occasionally, disease may be produced by the water made use of for domestic purposes becoming impregnated with metallic impurities not originally contained in it, but arising from the tanks and pipes in which it remains, and through which it passes. Want of room and not of matter prevents the entering more fully upon this subject, but enough has been given to show that if, as has been asserted by many physicians, Pure water is the fittest drink for persons of all ages and temperaments, it may with equal truth be said, that Impure water is one of the fruitful sources of disease.</p>
<p>Few persons are aware of the great number of living animals, and the mass of putrid animal and vegetable matter contained in the water drawn from wells supplied from land springs; or in that obtained from lakes, ponds, or brooks, making the water disagreeable to the taste, smell, and sight, and engendering disease.</p>
<pb n="3" id="p3a"/>
<p>The inhabitants of the large towns and cities of Great Britain generally receive the water they drink, and use for culinary purposes, from the rivers that flow through or near the towns in which they dwell. The water from these rivers not only contains the deleterious substances found in wells and ponds, but is also contaminated with the Sewage from the drains, the refuse of chemical works, and a thousand other nuisances. Should any one be disposed to doubt the statements made, they will find them fully borne out by the evidence given by the most eminent medical and scientific men before the General Board of Health; and by the record of the Analytical Sanitary Commission, given in the <hi rend="italics">Lancet,</hi> February, 1851. It is from this source the annexed engravings are copied, reduced to nearly half the size.</p>

<p>This engraving shows the more remarkable animal and vegetable productions found in the water of the Thames at Waterloo Bridge, magnified 140 diameters.</p>
<p>This is the state of the Thames water at a part of the river where the contents of the large sewers of the metropolis become mixed with the fluid. Dr. Hassall in his examination states, &ldquo;that the great amount of animal life present in the water of the Thames near the bridges, is directly dependent on the organic matter contained in it which is derived principally from the Sewer water daily poured into the river, the animalcul&aelig; finding in it the means of subsistence and growth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though the Thames is most contaminated as it flows through the more densely inhabited part of the metropolis, yet long before it reaches London it contains an abundance of animal and vegetable matter, as may be seen in the annexed engraving (Fig. 2), representing the principal objects in a drop of water taken from the Thames at Richmond. Magnified 140 diameters.</p>
<p>

<figure id="ill4"><p>FIG. 2.</p></figure></p>

<p>These engravings can only represent the substances found in the water; the putrid animal and vegetable matters that infect the fluid, although invisible, combine to make us concur in the evidence taken by the Commissioners, &ldquo;that the Thames from Kew to Woolwich is in a state unfitted for human consumption;&rdquo; and the same remark applies to the water obtained from the Lea, the Brent, and other sources.</p>
<p>The source of the New River is at Amwell, in Hertfordshire. Thence it winds its slow stream to the metropolis, receiving additions on its way from the Lea and other streams. The distance of Amwell from London by the road is about twenty-two miles, but the length of the river is nearly double that number of miles. It is open nearly the whole of the distance, receiving the refuse animal and vegetable matter of the places through which it passes; nevertheless, the water of the New River is much purer than the Thames. The drop of water containing the objects represented in the engraving (Fig. 3) was taken from a cistern near the New River Head. The specimen is magnified 140 diameters.</p>

<p>The objects represented show that no one would from choice drink either of these waters, or use them for culinary purposes. All the sources from which the daily supply of water for upwards of two millions of human beings is obtained are objectionable, containing matter disagreeable to the taste, sight, and smell, and prejudicial to health.</p>
<p>3. <hi rend="italics">Method of Purifying Water.</hi>&mdash;Although various contrivances have been proposed for the purpose of effecting this desirable object, yet it must be acknowledged that most of them have signally failed, and that the use of Purified water is adopted by comparatively few, the causes of which may be ascribed to the imperfection of the means employed, the trouble and expense of the methods, and the deficient supply of Pure water yielded by all the ordinary Filters.</p>
<p>Natural stone has for a long time been used as a filtering agent, but the frequent inequality of its texture, and its liability to become choked, have much limited its employment; layers of sand often form the basis of a Filter, but when so constructed, the Filters are apt to become deranged in their action, choked with filth, rendered worse than useless, and with great difficulty restored to a useful condition.</p>
<p>The discovery of Mr. Ransome's Artificial Stone, which can be made of any degree of porosity, of complete uniformity of texture throughout, and can be moulded of any required shape and size, and which possesses the advantage of being exceedingly cheap, has at length enabled Filters to be formed which possess all the advantages which can be desired, and by means of which an almost unlimited supply of filtered water can be obtained without trouble, and with certainty and rapidity.</p>
<p>The stone itself, the basis of the Filters, consists of the fine particles of pure sand, united together by means of glass, which is first added to the sand in a liquid state, and after the stone has been moulded, is reduced to a solid form by means of heat. Stone is thus produced of any degree of porosity, depending on the fineness or coarseness of the grit. The quality of the material is such as to have obtained for its discoverer the <hi rend="italics">Medal of the Society of Civil Engineers, the Medal of the Great Exhibition,</hi> and the encomiums of such competent judges as Cubitt, Buckland, Faraday, De la B&egrave;che, R. Phillips, Ansted, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p>The various forms of Filters constructed with the Patent Stone, adapted to every purpose, and suitable to all circumstances of life, will be seen in the annexed description.</p>
<p>By its passage through these Filters, water can be readily freed from all the mechanical impurities which it contains, as undissolved animal and vegetable matters; and such is sufficient for the purification of many kinds of water; but for the purpose of removing dissolved matters and any taints which it may contain, other methods are made use of, consisting of the introduction between the plates of stone of a deodorizing and disinfecting substance, the basis of which is <hi rend="italics">animal charcoal,</hi> a body which does not act merely by straining or filtration, but which, when properly prepared, has the power of absorbing any noxious matters which it may meet with. Vegetable charcoal has often been made use of in the construction of Filters, but its powers of purifying are very small, and soon exhausted. Such, however, is not the case with the animal charcoal; and we need only refer to the experiments of <hi rend="italics">Dr. Garrod,</hi> published in the Transactions of the Medical Society of London, for a proof of its extraordinary powers, and which have been fully confirmed by <hi rend="italics">Dr. Rand,</hi> of Philadelphia. It is there shown that the most poisonous vegetable substances are rendered perfectly harmless when mixed with even small quantities of this body. If such is its power when used with deadly and rapid poisons, how much more can it remove the minute quantities of tainted and injurious substances contained in many waters, which more slowly, yet not less certainly, produce injurious effects upon the health?</p>
<p>It is found also that the minute quantities of lead and other metallic impurities contained in water are effectually absorbed by the charcoal. By the use of this agent, which in the <hi rend="italics">Patant Stone Filters</hi> can be readily renewed at the most trifling cost, even the most impure waters can be rendered both sweet and wholesome.</p>

<p><hi rend="italics">Description of Ransome's Patent Stone Filter and Purifier.</hi></p>

<p><figure id="ill6"><p>FIG. 4. <lb/> FILTER.</p></figure></p>

<p><figure id="ill7"><p>FIG. 5. <lb/> PURIFIER.</p></figure></p>

<p>Before proceeding to describe the shape, size, and price of the Filters and Purifiers manufactured by Mr. Ransome, it will be necessary to explain the difference between a <hi rend="italics">Filter</hi> and a <hi rend="italics">Purifier.</hi></p>
<p>When water is obtained from a well that is unconnected with any sewage or stagnant water, it will probably contain living animalcul&aelig;, and earthy particles, which make it look dark and turbid, though perfectly free from smell. This water only requires filtering, to make it bright and wholesome. By referring to Fig. 4, in the annexed engraving, the reader will find a representation of a filter. The vessel containing the water is supposed to be transparent. <hi rend="italics">a</hi> is the impure water. <hi rend="italics">b,</hi> a layer of sand. <hi rend="italics">c,</hi> a round flat artificial stone, about one inch thick; this is the filter, through which the water passes. <hi rend="italics">d,</hi> the filtered water.</p>
<p>This Filter is very simple, and can never get out of repair, and requires no other cleansing than to remove the sand, when it becomes too dirty to allow the water to pass through it.</p>
<p><hi rend="italics">The Purifier.</hi> Fig. 5.&mdash;When water not only contains animalcul&aelig;, but also animal and vegetable matter, in a dissolved and putrid state, and has a disagreeable taste and smell, it not only requires filtering, but also purifying, before it is fit to drink, or made use of, in Cooking. Fig. 5 is a representation of Ransome and Co's patent Purifier. The reader must again suppose the vessel to be transparent, to show the interior management of the Purifier. <hi rend="italics">a</hi> is the impure water. <hi rend="italics">b,</hi> a layer of sand. <hi rend="italics">c,</hi> a perforated cover, laid on the sand. <hi rend="italics">d,</hi> the chemical disinfectant. <hi rend="italics">e,</hi> a filter, a flat porous slab. <hi rend="italics">f,</hi> the filtered and purified water.</p>
<p>The reader will perceive that the Purifier differs from the Filter, by the introduction of the chemical disinfectant, between the two round slabs of porous stone. The upper part of the vessel, containing the impure water, can be easily cleansed, by removing the perforated cover, and washing away the dirty sand. The action of the Purifier will be restored, by placing a layer of fresh sand over the flat stone, and placing the perforated cover upon the sand.</p>
<p>This apparatus is especially designed for the perfect restoration of rain, stagnant, or other foul water, to a state of pristine purity, by the <lb/> ABSTRACTION OF ALL DELETERIOUS PROPERTIES, <lb/> however subtle and minute, held both in solution and suspension, which are so offensive to the taste as well as injurious to the health. The principle of its construction ensures thorough purification and filtration. The water, after passing through the Patent Filtering Stone, is submitted to the action of a chemical disinfectant, and is thus rendered equal in quality to the purest spring water, being bright and sparkling to the eye, and fresh and lively to the palate. Among the principal advantages this apparatus possesses over others designed for the same purpose are the following:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. The water, by passing through the porous stone, is deprived of any remaining matters that may be held in suspension; the <hi rend="italics">chemical disinfectant,</hi> therefore, has only to purify the liquid, by the abstraction of any subtle or poisonous element that may be left in <hi rend="italics">solution,</hi> and this process it most effectually accomplishes without the risk of being obstructed by foul substances; the liability to derangement from choking is, therefore, out of the question.</p>
<p>2. In the construction of the <hi rend="italics">disinfectants,</hi> the Manufacturers have availed themselves of
<pb n="6" id="p6a"/>
the highest scientific and chemical knowledge, and the result will be best seen by a perusal of the appended testimonials.</p>
<p>3. For efficiency, portability, and cheapness, these Purifiers are without a rival.</p>


<p><figure id="ill8"><p>FIG. 6. <lb/> FIG. 7. <lb/> COTTAGE FILTERS.</p></figure></p>
<p>These cheap and convenient Filters will produce four gallons of clear wholesome water per day. They will stand on a dresser or shelf, and require very little room, being about six inches in diameter, and twelve inches high. Price, in plain cases, from 6<hi rend="italics">s.</hi> 6<hi rend="italics">d.</hi></p>
<p>The labourer or mechanic will save the amount of one of these Filters in a few weeks, in Tea alone, one-third less being required to make the same quantity of tea of greater strength, where soft filtered water is used, than can be produced by the hard, impure water commonly in use.</p>
<p>These Filters will be found serviceable in filtering soft water for washing: less soap will be required, and less wear of the articles.</p>
<p>Filters of any size can be had, if required.</p>

<p><figure id="ill9"><p>FIG. 8. <lb/> FIG. 9. <lb/> PARLOUR, BAR, OR SHOP FILTERS.</p></figure></p>


<p>These Filters will filter from five to six gallons of water per day. They are variously formed and ornamented. They are about seven inches in diameter, and one foot four inches high, (price 10<hi rend="italics">s.</hi> 6<hi rend="italics">d.</hi> plain,) and form a fit ornament for a side-board or bracket. They cause no wet or dirt, and, unless destroyed, can never be out of repair. They seldom require cleansing, and when that operation is thought necessary, it can be performed in five minutes, without the slightest chance of injuring the Filter. These Filters will be found particularly useful in a <hi rend="italics">confectioner's</hi> shop, especially during the summer, where, by placing a small piece of ice in the water, it will come from the Filter cold and sparkling, a luxurious and wholesome draught.</p>
<p><hi rend="italics">Tavern keepers</hi> will find great advantage in the use of the patent stone Filter, for cold mixtures, the water being perfectly clear and cool. The mixture will be transparent to the eye, and pleasant to the taste. When boiled, the filtered water will give forth the full flavour of the spirit with which it is mixed, which it is impossible to obtain from unfiltered water.</p>

<p>The above will be found particularly serviceable in the housekeeper's room, the butler's pantry, or the farm house. Water from ponds or wells, however turbid, or even tainted by stagnation or other causes, by passing through the Stone Filter, is rendered perfectly clear and wholesome. The Filters and Purifiers will be found of great service on board ship or steam-vessel, and if enclosed in strong wicker-work, will not be liable to injury. The Filters and Purifiers can be made of any size or shape required, but the above are found to answer for most purposes.</p>
<p><figure id="ill14"><p>FIG. 14. <lb/> PATENT STONE SYPHON FILTERS.</p></figure></p>
<p>The most novel, cheap, and easily applied Filter is the Patent Stone Syphon Filter. Fig. 14 shows their usual shape, but they can be made of any shape or size required. A traveller arriving at any place where the spring water is so hard that it is unfit for use, either for making tea or for mixing spirits&mdash;or the soft water so disagreeable to the taste or sight that he dislikes to use it&mdash;if he possesses a Syphon Filter, which weighs
<pb n="8" id="p8a"/>
about four pounds, and can be easily packed in a travelling trunk, may procure an abundant supply of pure, sparkling, wholesome water, in a few minutes: he has only to order a pail of water to be brought to his apartment, and placed upon a table. Before immersing the circular Filter in the pail, it will be necessary to attach the small gutta percha pipe, having a tap at one end of it, (fig. 16,) to the screw in the centre of the Filter; then, placing the Filter in the pail, let the gutta percha pipe hang over the side of it, so that the tap at the end of the pipe comes below the pail. The pipe thus becomes a syphon, and the water when drawn from the Filter will be found perfectly clear and fit for use.</p>

<p>Fig. 16 shows the syphon before it is attached to the Filter. The air must be drawn from the syphon when it is inserted in the pail by placing the end of the pipe between the lips and inhaling the air for half a second, when the filtered water will rush into the mouth; then turn the tap, and gently hang down the pipe; again turn the tap, and a continuous stream of fresh water will run into the glass, E.

<p><figure id="ill17"><p>FIG. 17. <lb/> THE GOBLET FILTER.</p></figure></p>
<p>The Goblet Filter is another invention for the convenience of travellers by sea or land. The Filter is made in the form of a cup, which is placed in a goblet-shaped vessel of glass or earthenware. The impure water, as served out at sea, A, is poured into the porous stone filter, B; it immediately runs through it, and fills the goblet with filtered water, C; it is drawn from the goblet by means of a small tap. For chemists its use will be found invaluable for many operations in the laboratory, releasing them from the inconvenience that ever attends the use of paper.</p>

<p><figure id="ill18"><p>FIG. 18. <lb/> THE CISTERN FILTER.</p></figure></p>
<p>Ransome's Patent Filter is found to be admirably adapted for cisterns and water-butts. It consists of an angular vessel, composed of artificial stone of a peculiarly fine yet porous character. The annexed engraving will best show its form and appearance, when placed in a horizontal position in the cistern.</p>

<p>THE MILITARY CAMP AT CHOBHAM.&mdash;Amongst the novel objects of interest, combined with the portability necessary for military encampment, is a mode of obtaining pure water at the Camp. A filter of porous stone (we believe Ransome's patent) is placed in a barrel. The barrel is then filled from the nearest reservoir with water, which permeates through the stone to the interior, and thence is conveyed, by a conduit pipe, through the barrel; at the exterior of which it terminates in a tap, by which it may be drawn off in any quantity, the filter being always charged with pure water, rendered delightfully cool by the refrigerant body around it.&mdash;ILLUSTRATED LONDON NEWS, July 30th, 1853.</p>
<p>RANSOME'S FILTER.&mdash;Public attention is being directed to a peculiar kind of Filter patented by Messrs. RANSOME and MAY, of Ipswich. This machine is manufactured in the Patent Stone made by the same firm and which attracted the notice of Chemists in the Great Exhibition of 1851. This material can be made of any degree of porosity, of complete uniformity of texture throughout, and can be moulded of any required shape and size; it consists of the fine particles of pure sand united together by means of glass which is first added to the sand in a liquid state, and after the stone has been moulded is reduced to a solid form by means of heat. The filtration of the water is thus accomplished easily by placing the filter made of this stone in any vessel containing the fluid and attaching to it a pipe with a tap at the end communicating with the outside of the vessel. The advantages of this Filter consist in its simplicity, the perfection of the filtration, the coolness of the filtered fluid, and the cheapness of construction. These Filters seem to possess all the qualities required by lovers of pure water. The Patentees have applied their invention to vessels of all kinds.</p>

<p>SIR, &mdash; I have examined the Filter received from your Establishment, and think it answers admirably all the purposes for which a Filter is required. Its compactness and portability greatly recommend it, arising, I presume, from the employment of artificial stone discs in the place of the ordinary layers of sand. Again, it thoroughly purifies as well as filters, stagnant water being deprived of all noxious qualities, and rendered free from odour or taste. Its powers, however, are not confined simply to the removal of ordinary taint, for it also separates poisonous principles, and renders the filtered fluid harmless. Understanding that animal charcoal was one of the materials employed in its construction, and having previously investigated the powers of this substance, I submitted the Filter to two searching tests:&mdash; First, I passed an infusion of opium, and then one of rhubarb, through it; in both instances the fluid became perfectly colourless, tasteless, and inodorous, and did not exhibit any trace of these substances when chemically examined. Therefore, should water at any time become poisonous, the use of your Filter will render it innoxious. That it does become so occasionally, we have ample evidence from the symptoms caused by the water of certain countries; and during the late epidemic of cholera, many facts appeared to show a close connexion between the health of a locality and the purity of the water with which it was supplied.&mdash;In all cases the advantage of using pure water must be obvious to every person.</p>

<p>THERE are many facts which prove that impurities in the water used for drinking and for culinary purposes have quite as much influence in causing disease, especially of an epidemic character, as have impurities of the air. It is consequently of great importance that almost every family should be provided with a good Filter, since the water, not only of rivers, but also that of wells, is liable to become contaminated. I have used one of Ransome's Patent Water Purifiers for some time, and am highly satisfied with its action. Besides rendering the water perfectly clear, by the separation of all the particles, however minute, that are suspended in it, this Filter also removes organic matter which is held in solution.</p>

<p><hi rend="italics">Novel Filterer.</hi>&mdash;An ingenious, novel, and very efficacious method of filtering water has lately been contrived. The filter is a cylinder, formed of a porous stone of a peculiar quality; through this substance nothing passes but the pure element, all foreign and deleterious substances being stopped. The simplicity of the construction of this instrument or machine is its great recommendation, and in that respect it is superior to the numerous kinds of filters generally employed, which, though they have their benefits, are almost all, to a certain degree, complex or defective. This simplicity of contrivance insures the lasting properties of the filter; indeed, it would appear that it can receive little or no injury from wear and tear, neither does it require to be continually cleansed or put to rights, as it, in a manner, purifies itself at the same time that it purifies the water that passes through it.</p>

<p>SIR,&mdash;Having been referred to for an opinion as to the Filter best suited for domestic purposes, I requested your agents to send me a small one of your construction, to compare its capabilities with those of other makers. After a series of experiments and trials of its purifying properties, made not only with foul water, but also with various vegetable and saline solutions, I am bound to say I found your Filter give a more uniform quantity of pure water as the result in a stated time; and it also affords proof of a greater purifying power than any other that has yet come under my notice.</p>

<p>DEAR SIR,&mdash;You ask me for my opinion upon the &ldquo;Porous Stone Filter&rdquo; I have had in use; this I readily give, for the following reasons:&mdash;That my attention has been drawn to the water-supply of London for several years past, both chemically and microscopically. The latter examinations have indeed often surprised me from the very large quantity of living animalcul&aelig; and the debris of dead matters I have constantly found present in the water taken from my cistern&mdash;a small quantity of which will afford an evening's amusement for my children, and a most convincing argument to my friends of the injury that must arise to health from the daily use of water from so corrupt a source. I have likewise been at some trouble to investigate the supplies and the storing of water in Emigrant ships. Mrs. Chisholm has pointed out to me the deplorable results that have been known to ensure on shipboard from the want of wholesome drinking water. These, with other circumstances, have led me to inquire into the various modes of purification adopted, and I must say that all <hi rend="italics">filterers</hi> hitherto have more or less disappointed me, from their being liable to become so quickly foul and choked up when large quantities of water are sent through them, and from the neglect of those in charge of them not keeping up a daily and fresh supply, and at the same time rejecting and clearing away the refuse of former days.</p>
<p>When my attention was first directed to your &ldquo;Patent Porous Stone Filter,&rdquo; I saw immediately that this would remedy most of the evils complained of, not alone from its chemical composition (which is very good), but also from the mode of using it, namely, that of <hi rend="italics">fixing it into the water cistern,</hi> and thereby causing the whole supply of the house to pass through it, arresting the danger on the very threshold. I must say that the trial has fully realized my expectations. One instance of its usefulness is most agreeably exemplified in the kitchen-boiler, which we all know must be constantly cleaned out to remove the large deposit of carbonate of lime, with other organic matters, thus rendering the water unsightly and unsuited for use; this is now always clear and wholesome, and the damage done to the boiler by these deposits prevented. I have quite satisfied myself that the water is also rendered not only clean but pure; after standing-by some of it for a week, I have at the end of that time examined it with the microscope, and have not found any living animalcul&aelig;. I have purposely mixed deleterious substances with water, and then passed it through the filter, when I have been unable to detect them, even by the aid of chemical re-agents&mdash;the water proving perfectly sweet, and fit for drinking. This is a matter of no small importance, since careful investigators have clearly traced the ravages of fearful epidemics to the contaminated state of the water used in some localities.</p>

<p>GENTLEMEN,&mdash;I am acquainted with the nature of Mr. RANSOME'S Patent stone, manufactured for filtering purposes. From the nature of its construction I consider the material is eminently adapted for use in filtering, as at once porous and indestructible, consisting of particles of silica cemented by glass, and altogether insoluble in water. I believe no natural stone exists which possesses these advantages to so great an extent, and that none of the contrivances hitherto used for filtering are equally simple and efficacious. It can never become choked, as the mere passage of clean water through it in the direction opposite to that commonly used, will at any time clean it thoroughly. It can be made of any required form for small filters, and in slabs for those of large size, and is extremely cheap.</p>

<p>GENTLEMEN,&mdash;I have great pleasure in offering my testimony to the value of your Patent Stone Filter. I have had one in operation a considerable time, and am glad to say it filters perfectly and rapidly, has never been out of order, and from its peculiar principle of filtering, it will doubtless continue to filter for years without the necessity of any change whatever. The fact of its being placed in the midst of the water requiring filtration, I consider an important quality, since the filtered water retains all its original temperature, and consequent freshness.</p>

<p>Dr. FARADAY said, this substance appeared to be a collection of particles of sandstone grit, intimately combined with the silicate of soda, by whose tenacious properties, when fused, they were held together, as by a kind of glass, enveloping the particles.</p>
<p>Mr. RANSOME'S stone is not acted on by acids. It contains about 92 per cent. of silica, and is, in fact, a sandstone, the particles of which are united by a siliceous cement of the most indestructible character; and, judging from its chemical composition, I should consider it difficult to find a substance better adapted to the purposes for which it is intended.&mdash;</p>

<opener>
<dateline>Read at the Ordinary General Meeting of the Royal Institute of British Architects, June 2nd, 1851.</dateline>
</opener>
<p>WITHIN a short period, Mr. Ransome has proposed an application of his filtering stone, which appears likely to satisfy the conditions essential to the success of that operation. The stone itself is an artificial sandstone, whose degree of porosity can be regulated at pleasure. For the purpose of two Filters, it is proposed that slabs of this stone, about two inches in thickness, should be substituted for the common tiles used in the other filters. Under all circumstances, it is necessary to introduce such a quantity of sand as is necessary to retain the grosser matters. The top of this sand could be cleared off very easily by a trowel or rake. The head of water required to work these filters is very small; with four feet pressure, the two slabs, covered with three inches of sand, have filtered at the rate of 340 gallons per foot superficial per day. The price of the slabs is stated to be 3<hi rend="italics">s.</hi> per foot superficial; and if the additional works necessary in the construction be also taken into account, the total expense of a Filter of this description, calculated to yield one million gallons per day, would not exceed &pound;1400.</p>
<p>Ransome's Filters have been in use for a considerable time for house supply, and have been adopted in many large factories, and their applications is still extending.</p>
<p>Ransome's Filter seems generally the most economical, on account of the diminished amount of the excavation, the lesser area, and the smaller head required.</p>

<p>In the Great Exhibition of 1851, among the objects that challenged the attention of the thousands of visitors was the Iris Fountain, about eighteen inches in diameter, from the centre of which a jet shot up more than three feet in height, the water then separated and fell&mdash;not in a descending stream, but in a sparkling succession of liquid particles, forming a feathery spray, upon which, when the light was favourable, appeared a beautiful miniature rainbow. It was from this circumstance that the jet d'eau obtained its name.</p>
<p>This elegant decoration may now be obtained at the <hi rend="italics">Dep&ocirc;t,</hi> 71, <hi rend="italics">Baker Street, Portman Square, London.</hi> The Iris Fountain is peculiarly adapted, in its variety of forms, for dining, drawing, and ball rooms, or for the boudoir and conservatory. Perfumed waters may, by the agency of this fountain, be brought into continuous contact with the atmosphere, producing a refreshing and luxurious effect. It is portable, simple in its mechanism, and perfect in itself: it is not liable to derangement. The Iris Fountain will continue playing upwards of three hours, and when the jet becomes languid, any person can restore its perfect action in two seconds, by merely turning it round as it stands upon the table or pedestal, when it will again play for three hours. This simple means of revival may be repeated with the same effect at pleasure.</p>
<p>The Iris Fountain is complete in itself, requiring no fittings or water pipes for supply or waste whatever; the water once supplied to the fountain, and ejected by its action, returns to be again thrown out; the only loss of water, therefore, will be by evaporation.</p>

This Part will contain Specimens of the skill of the celebrated Artists to whom has been entrusted the erections and embellishments of the TOMB OF NAPOLEON I. under the <foreign lang="fre">Cupola of the Invalides</foreign>.

<p>THE WORKS OF EMINENT MASTERS will, as it proceeds, reveal the Artistic treasures of Europe as contained in the various Public and Private Galleries of different Nations. Some of these Galleries are as &ldquo;fountains sealed&rdquo; to the majority, and others are only accessible at the expense of much form and ceremony, and a considerable portion of time. The contents of some of them have, it is true, been published, but at a price which places them beyond the reach of the mass of the people. The object of the Proprietor and Publisher of the WORKS OF EMINENT MASTERS is to supply this desideratum; and he rejoices that he has the means of placing within the reach of the humblest individual a Work of unparalleled beauty and excellence. His aim in this enterprise is to keep pace with the important movements recently made to beget and foster a love for the beautiful in Art&mdash;to place before the humble but aspiring art-student, models which he may profitably imitate, and to encourage and stimulate the improved and improving taste of the present age.</p>
<p>THE WORKS OF EMINENT MASTERS will include Specimens of the performances of those who, at different periods, and in various countries, have distinguished themselves as Masters, whether in Painting, Sculpture, Architecture, or Decorative Art. These will be accompanied, in most instances, with Portraits and Biographical Notices of the Artists.</p>
<p>A VOLUME of the WORKS OF EMINENT MASTERS will be completed yearly, containing the Twelve Parts issued Monthly. The materials have been selected with the greatest care, and no expense has been spared as to the machinery, or as to anything requisite for producing a Work of the highest merit&mdash;a Work which will be sure to commend itself to every lover of Fine Art.</p>

</div2> 
<div2 type="section"><head>THE HISTORICAL EDUCATOR</head>
<p>Will form a UNIVERSAL HISTORY, and will, as it proceeds, open up to the People rich stores of knowledge hitherto accessible but to a privileged few. The History of Geography, or the Discoveries made by eminent Travellers and Voyagers, will be a most interesting Department, the collection of the materials for which has engaged the labour of several years. The Engravings for the illustration of the Chapters in this course will involve an outlay of more than TWO THOUSAND POUNDS. The Work will be divided into Departments, as follows:&mdash;</p><div3 type="section"> 
<head>I.&mdash;THE HISTORY OF DISCOVERY,</head>
<p>Commencing with the Voyages and Travels of HERODOTUS, whom Cicero called the &ldquo;Father of History,&rdquo; and whose investigations into the Origin and History of Nations, written about 450 years before the commencement of the Christian Era, caused him to be known and greatly admired throughout Greece.</p>
</div3> 
<div3 type="section"><head>II.&mdash;THE HISTORY OF AMERICA, from its First Discovery by Columbus.</head>
<p>This portion of the Work has been entrusted to that charming and popular writer, Mrs. MARY HOWITT, whose aim it will be to render it peculiarly interesting to the young, at the same time furnishing ample information to all who desire a perfect knowledge of the rise, progress, and present condition of a country allied to Great Britain by so many endearing recollections.</p>
</div3><div3 type="section"> 
<head>III.&mdash;THE HISTORY OF GREECE, ANCIENT AND MODERN.</head>
<p>This is entrusted to EDWIN L. GODKIN, Esq., Author of the &ldquo;Popular History of Hungary,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
</div3><div3> 
<head>IV.&mdash;CHRONOLOGY.</head>
<p>This Department will comprise a compendious outline of General History, from the Creation to the present time, including Remarkable Events, Discoveries and Inventions, and the Era, Country, and Writings of Learned Men.</p>
<p>Every Number will contain a portion of each of the above Departments</p>
<p>The entire Work will include the Discoveries of the most ancient Travellers and Voyagers, anterior to the fall of the Western Empire; those of the middle Ages, to the termination of the Eastern Empire; also the Histories of those Countries with the names of which the majority are acquainted, but whose origin, and the manners and customs of whose inhabitants, are but little or imperfectly known. It will, of course, include the records of modern Travellers and Voyagers, relating to the present state of those countries which figured most conspicuously in Ancient History, and which have left upon them an impress of their greatness, exciting the admiration of successive generations.</p>
<p>Each Chapter of THE HISTORICAL EDUCATOR will be accompanied with copious Notes and References, obtained from sources to which few have access; and these, together with the very numerous PICTORIAL ILLUSTRATIONS, will furnish a vast amount of the most curious and instructive information.</p>
<p>THE HISTORICAL EDUCATOR will be uniform in size with the Fine Paper Edition of THE POPULAR EDUCATOR, to which Work it will form a valuable companion.</p>

<head>THE POPULAR EDUCATOR.</head>
<p>NEW SERIES OF STUDIES.</p>
<p>WITH the Fourth Volume of THE POPULAR EDUCATOR, the First Number of which will be published October 1, will commence an entirely new and most important Course of Lessons. In the First, Second, and Third Volumes, Lessons for the easy acquirement of LANGUAGES have been the chief feature; the Fourth and Fifth Volumes will have for their principal subject PHILOSOPHY. The Scientific Course will commence with <hi rend="italics">Natural Philosophy</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Chemistry.</hi> The Heads of Schools and Families will find these Lessons the most popular and instructive that have ever been published.</p>
<p>The Course of NATURAL PHILOSOPHY will include the following branches, which will be illustrated with upwards of Five Hundred beautifully executed Engravings:&mdash;The Properties of Matter. Force and Motion; Gravity, and Molecular Attraction; Hydrostatics and Hydronamics; Properties of Aerial Fluids; Acoustics; Heat, including an Account of the Steam-engine; Optics, comprising the Properties of Light, the Laws of Vision, and a Description of Optical Instruments; Magnetism; Statical Electricity; Dynamical Electricity; Meteorology, and Climatology.</p>
<p>The LESSONS IN CHEMISTRY will be written in the most lucid style, so that even children may comprehend them. They will be made applicable to much of the common business of life, and will open a rich source of instruction and rational entertainment. These Lessons also will be accompanied by appropriate Engravings.</p>
<p>But, though the leading feature of THE POPULAR EDUCATOR commencing with Volume the Fourth will be the above-named Sciences, Languages, and other branches of knowledge, will not be omitted. The first of a Course of Lessons in the ITALIAN Language will be given in the First Number of that Volume.</p>
<p>In order that full justice may be rendered to the Illustrations, upon the preparation of which a large sum has been expended, and to meet the desire expressed by a great number of Subscribers, the whole Edition will be printed upon Fine Paper, and without the Weekly Headings, similar in size and price to the Fine Paper Edition of THE POPULAR EDUCATOR, which has given so much satisfaction. The result will be a very handsome Volume, worthy a place in any Library. The Weekly Numbers will be 1&frac12;d. each; the Monthly Parts, 7d., or, if containing Five Numbers, 8&frac12;d. each.</p>

Parts I., II., and III. are now ready, <lb/> THE CONTENTS OF WHICH ARE AS FOLLOWS:-</p>
<p>Introductory Address: Description of the Purpose and Plan of the Work&mdash;Natural Science&mdash;Galileo and the Inquisition&mdash;Course of Systematic Theology, Nos. 1 to 6&mdash;The Literary History of the Bible, with Diagrams and Illustrations&mdash;Historical Sketch of the Hebrew Inspired Poets&mdash;Biblical Allusions Illustrated by Eastern Scenes, with Illustrations&mdash;The Arts as illustrative of Sacred Scriptures, with Illustrations &mdash; Synoptical Table of the Prophets &mdash; Rules for the Interpretation of Prophecy&mdash;Inscriptions on the Rocks of Sinai, with Illustrations&mdash;The Succession of Biblical Literature&mdash;National Calendar of the Jews&mdash;Hard Texts Explained&mdash;Biblical Chronology&mdash;A Mother's Lessons on the Gospel&mdash;Historical Difficulties of Infidelity&mdash;Antiquities of the Jews, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p>The object of this Publication is to supply the People with such information relating to the study of the Bible as THE POPULAR EDUCATOR has given in reference to Secular Instruction. It is intended for the use of the intelligent and devout readers of the authorized version, is written in a popular style, avoiding as much as possible all scholastic terms and technical phrases, and will give to the plain English reader, not a formidable show of learning, but its intelligible results. It is, therefore, specially adapted to supply Families, Sunday-school Teachers, and others, with that amount of information respecting the Holy Bible which they need in order to meet the charges of Infidels and the subtleties of Romanists, and to confirm and establish their own minds in the genuineness and authenticity of Holy Writ.</p>
<p>Wherever the subject requires Pictorial Illustrations they are introduced, and no expense will be spared to render this Work one of the most useful ever issued.</p>
<p>The List of Contributors to the POPULAR BIBLICAL EDUCATOR includes the names of some of the most Eminent Writers of the present day.&mdash;The Work is issued for the 1st and 15th of each month.</p>

<p>EDITED BY THE REV. JOHN HARRIS, D.D., <lb/> <hi rend="italics">Principal of New College, St. John's Wood, London; Author of &ldquo;The Great Teacher;&rdquo;</hi> <lb/> <hi rend="italics">&ldquo;Mammon;&rdquo; &ldquo;Pre-Adamite Earth,&rdquo; &amp;c., &amp;c.,</hi></p>

<head>ASSISTED BY EMINENT CONTRIBUTORS.</head>
<p>&ldquo;The principal part of family religion,&rdquo; said Archbishop Tillotson, &ldquo;is prayer every morning and evening, and reading some portion of Scripture: and this is so necessary to keep alive a sense of God and religion in the minds of men, that, when it is neglected, I do not see how any family can, in reason, be esteemed a family of Christians, or, indeed, have any religion at all.&rdquo; &ldquo;And,&rdquo; says Doddridge, in the &ldquo;Address to the Master of a Family,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;God only knows what a Church may arise from one godly family, what a harvest may spring up from a single seed: and, on the other hand, it is impossible to say how many souls may perish by the treacherous neglect of a single person, and, to speak plainly, by <hi rend="italics">your own.</hi>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The desirableness desirableness of such a Publication is too obvious to need remark. Even amongst those in whose hearts the spirit of devotion is pure and ardent, a difficulty of expression, or a desire to avoid day after day the repetition of the same phrases while referring to common occurrences&mdash;acknowledging &ldquo;everyday blessings,&rdquo; or praying for their daily renewal&mdash;frequently produces considerable embarrassment; while others&mdash;as, for instance, females in the absence of the head of the family&mdash;in consequence of nervousness or timidity, are prevented from leading the devotions of the household. To such persons THE ALTAR OF THE HOUSEHOLD will prove a valuable boon, whether used in the precise form in which it appears, or as suggesting a suitable train of thoughts and expressions. In these respects it may also greatly aid the private devotions of the closet.</p>

<div2><head>THE CLOSING OF THE STORY.</head>
<p>WHEN an Author has nearly spun out the thread of his narrative, his descriptions have connected him and the public so long that they have arrived at a <hi rend="italics">pretty good understanding,</hi> and possibly the Author thinks it is time to look out for some fresh subject to keep up the communication.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italics">good understanding</hi> between E. MOSES &amp; SON and the world's public, is the best basis on which Business communications can be established. The interest excited by their NOVEL Styles of ATTIRE cannot be excelled, and the comfort enjoyed in the <hi rend="italics">choicest</hi> ARTICLES OF DRESS has originated and long continued an intimate Business acquaintance with them, their friends, and the public.</p>
<p>Though SEPTEMBER may be considered neither SUMMER nor WINTER, there is no paucity of seasonable inventions and novel introductions in articles of ATTIRE, manufactured by E. MOSES &amp; SON. <hi rend="italics">&ldquo;Remaining Stock&rdquo;</hi> is a phrase they never need employ. Various as the months in the year and the days in the week are the elegancies and the utility of their productions. A vast amount of BUSINESS prevents the possibility of <hi rend="italics">&ldquo;unsold stock,&rdquo;</hi> and immense transactions render small profits remunerative.</p>
<p>DURING the month of SEPTEMBER everyone should inspect an assemblage of new Designs and new Articles of ATTIRE, HATS, CAPS, HOSIERY, BOOTS and SHOES, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p>SPORTSMEN may select such costume for their excursions and field exercises as display a perfect mastery in the TAILORING ART; a <hi rend="italics">fit</hi> in every sense correct and comfortable; <hi rend="italics">grace</hi> and <hi rend="italics">durability</hi> secured in every garment; and prices considerably lower than those charged elsewhere.</p>
<p>MERCHANT SHIPPERS and CAPTAINS are furnished with the most profitable cargoes at the Wholesale Department of E. MOSES &amp; SON'S ESTABLISHMENT. All classes of Emigrants OUTFITTED at WHOLESALE PRICES.</p>
