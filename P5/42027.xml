<p>THE peculiar feature of their Establishment is, that it is confined exclusively to the
Manufacture of BEDDING, and consequently they are enabled to keep the largest Stock and greatest
Variety of any House in London, including their
<lb/> FRENCH WOOL MATTRESSES:
<lb/> ALSO
<lb/> THE GERMAN SPRING MATTRESS.</p>
<p>This article HEAL AND SON have succeeded in greatly improving, and are Selling at a much LOWER
PRICE than any other House; and can recommend one of them, with a French Mattress on the top, as a
permanently elastic, soft, and most luxurious Bed.</p>
<p>THE EIDER-DOWN QUILT
<lb/> also, is to be seen ONLY at their House; it is the warmest, lightest, and most elegant
covering ever introduced; suitable to the Bed, the Couch, or the Carriage.</p>
<p>EVERY DESCRIPTION OF ENGLISH BEDDING,
<lb/> AND OF

<head>AN EXCELLENT cure of a DISORDER IN THE STOMACH effected by HOLLOWAY'S PILLS.—</head>
<p>A Lady, an intimate friend of the family of General Rosas, Governor of the Republic of La Piata,
declares that she was lately cured of a disorder in the stomach, and restored to perfect health, by
the use of this admirable remedy. She had consulted the most eminent physicians in the country, but
had not been able to obtain any relief from the complaint that was killing her by inches, until she
took Holloway's Pills. John Eastman, Esq., an eminent merchant of Buenos Ayres, communicated these
particulars to Professor HOLLOWAY in a letter dated the 4th September, 1849.—Sold by all druggists,
and at Professor. HOLLOWAY'S Establishment, 244, Strand, London.</p>

<head>HYDROPATHIC ESTABLISHMENT,
<lb/> SUDBROOK PARK, NEAR RICHMOND, SURREY.</head>
<p>THIS Institution, which has been in full and successful operation for eight years, is conducted
by JAMES ELLIS, M.D., who resides in the house, and has thus the opportunity of exercising a
constant superintendence of the treatment.</p>
<p>During a lengthened residence at Grafenburg, Dr. ELLIS had peculiar opportunities of studying the
principles and practice of the Water Cure, under Vincent Priessnitz, who has recommended patients
returning to England to place themselves under his care; added to which, he has made a personal
inspection of the first establishments on the Continent and in England.</p>
<p>His own experience during a practice of eight years, part of which he was a coadjutor of Dr.
Weiss, enables him confidently to assert, that all diseases curable, and many incurable by any
previously known means, can be safely and successfully treated by a proper application of the Water
Cure <hi rend="italics">alone.</hi></p>
<p>Sudbrook Park adjoins Richmond Park on its southern and sheltered side, and contains upwards of a

<lb/> PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE

<div type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER XXXV.
<lb/> DEPRESSION.</head>
<p>AS soon as I could recover my presence of mind, which quite deserted me in the first overpowering
shock of my aunt's intelligence, I proposed to Mr. Dick to come round to the chandler's shop, and
take possession of the bed which Mr. Peggotty had lately vacated. The chandler's shop being in
Hungerford Market, and Hungerford Market being a very different place in those days, there was a low
wooden colonnade before the door (not very unlike that before the house where the little man and
woman used to live, in the old weather-glass), which pleased Mr. Dick mightily. The glory of lodging
over this structure would have compensated him, I dare say, for many inconveniences; but, as there
were really few to bear, beyond the compound of flavors I have already mentioned, and perhaps the
want of a little more elbow-room, he was perfectly charmed with his accommodation. Mrs. Crupp had
indignantly assured him that there wasn't room to swing a cat there; but, as Mr. Dick justly
observed to me, sitting down on the foot of the bed, nursing his leg, “You know, Trotwood, I don't
want to swing a cat. I never do swing a cat. Therefore, what does that signify to <hi rend="italics"
>me!</hi>”</p>
<p>I tried to ascertain whether Mr. Dick had any understanding of the causes of this sudden and
great change in my aunt's affairs. As I might have expected, he had none at all. The only account he
could give of it, was, that my aunt had said to him, the day before yesterday, “Now, Dick, are you
really and truly the philosopher I take you for?” That then he had said, Yes, he hoped so. That then
my aunt had said, “Dick, I am ruined.” That then he had said “Oh, indeed!” That then my aunt had
praised him highly, which he was very glad of. And that then they had come to me, and had had
bottled porter and sandwiches on the road.</p>
<p>Mr. Dick was so very complacent, sitting on the foot of the bed, nursing his leg, and telling me
this, with his eyes wide open and a surprised smile, that I am sorry to say I was provoked into
explaining to him that ruin meant distress, want, and starvation; but, I was soon bitterly reproved
for this harshness, by seeing his face turn pale, and tears course down his lengthened cheeks, while
he fixed upon me a look of such unutterable woe, that it might have softened a far harder heart than
mine. I took infinitely greater pains to cheer him up again than I had taken to depress him; and I
soon understood (as I ought to have known at first) that he had been so confident, merely because of
his faith in the wisest and most wonderful of women, and his unbounded reliance on my intellectual
resources. The latter, I believe, he considered a match for any kind of disaster not absolutely
mortal.</p>
<p>“What can we do, Trotwood?” said Mr. Dick. “There's the Memorial—”</p>
<pb xml:id="p354"/>
<p>“To be sure there is,” said I. “But all we can do just now, Mr. Dick, is to keep a cheerful
countenance, and not let my aunt see that we are thinking about it.”</p>
<p>He assented to this in the most earnest manner; and implored me, if I should see him wandering an
inch out of the right course, to recal him by some of those superior methods which were always at my
command. But I regret to state that the fright I had given him proved too much for his best attempts
at concealment. All the evening his eyes wandered to my aunt's face, with an expression of the most
dismal apprehension, as if he saw her growing thin on the spot. He was conscious of this, and put a
constraint upon his head; but his keeping that immovable, and sitting rolling his eyes like a piece
of machinery, did not mend the matter at all. I saw him look at the loaf at supper (which happened
to be a small one), as if nothing else stood between us and famine; and when my aunt insisted on his
making his customary repast, I detected him in the act of pocketing fragments of his bread and
cheese; I have no doubt for the purpose of reviving us with those savings, when we should have
reached an advanced stage of attenuation.</p>
<p>My aunt, on the other hand, was in a composed frame of mind, which was a lesson to all of us—to
me, I am sure. She was extremely gracious to Peggotty, except when I inadvertently called her by
that name; and, strange as I knew she felt in London, appeared quite at home. She was to have my
bed, and I was to lie in the sitting-room, to keep guard over her. She made a great point of being
so near the river, in case of a conflagration; and I suppose really did find some satisfaction in
that circumstance.</p>
<p>“Trot, my dear,” said my aunt, when she saw me making preparations for compounding her usual
night-draught, “No!”</p>
<p>“Nothing, aunt?”</p>
<p>“Not wine, my dear. Ale.”</p>
<p>“But there is wine here, aunt. And you always have it made of wine.”</p>
<p>“Keep that, in case of sickness,” said my aunt. “We mustn't use it carelessly, Trot. Ale for me.
Half a pint.”</p>
<p>I thought Mr. Dick would have fallen, insensible. My aunt being resolute, I went out and got the
ale myself. As it was growing late, Peggotty and Mr. Dick took that opportunity of repairing to the
chandler's shop together. I parted from him, poor fellow, at the corner of the street, with his
great kite at his back, a very monument of human misery.</p>
<p>My aunt was walking up and down the room when I returned, crimping the borders of her nightcap
with her fingers. I warmed the ale and made the toast on the usual infallible principles. When it
was ready for her, she was ready for it, with her nightcap on, and the skirt of her grown turned
back on her knees.</p>
<p>“My dear,” said my aunt, after taking a spoonful of it; “it's a great deal better than wine. Not
half so bilious.”</p>
<p>I suppose I looked doubtful, for she added:</p>
<p>“Tut, tut, child. If nothing worse than Ale happens to us, we are well off.”</p>
<p>“I should think so myself, aunt, I am sure,” said I.</p>
<p>“Well, then, why <hi rend="italics">don't</hi> you think so?” said my aunt.</p>
<pb xml:id="p355"/>
<p>“Because you and I are very different people,” I returned.</p>
<p>“Stuff and nonsense, Trot!” replied my aunt.</p>
<p>My aunt went on with a quiet enjoyment, in which there was very little affectation, if any;
drinking the warm ale with a teaspoon, and soaking her strips of toast in it.</p>
<p>“Trot,” said she, “I don't care for strange faces in general, but I rather like that Barkis of
yours, do you know!”</p>
<p>“It's better than a hundred pounds to hear you say so!” said I.</p>
<p>“It's a most extraordinary world,” observed my aunt, rubbing her nose; “how that woman ever got
into it with that name, is unaccountable to me. It would be much more easy to be born a Jackson, or
something of that sort, one would think.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps she thinks so, too; it's not her fault,” said I.</p>
<p>“I suppose not,” returned my aunt, rather grudging the admission; “but it's very aggravating.
However, she's Barkis <hi rend="italics">now.</hi> That's some comfort. Barkis is uncommonly fond of
you, Trot.”</p>
<p>“There is nothing she would leave undone to prove it,” said I.</p>
<p>“Nothing, I believe,” returned my aunt. “Here, the poor fool has been begging and praying about
handing over some of her money—because she has got too much of it! A simpleton!”</p>
<p>My aunt's tears of pleasure were positively trickling down into the warm ale.</p>
<p>“She's the most ridiculous creature that ever was born,” said my aunt. “I knew, from the first
moment when I saw her with that poor dear blessed baby of a mother of yours, that she was the most
ridiculous of mortals. But there are good points in Barkis!”</p>
<p>Affecting to laugh, she got an opportunity of putting her hand to her eyes. Having availed
herself of it, she resumed her toast and her discourse together.</p>
<p>“Ah! Mercy upon us!” sighed my aunt. “I know all about it, Trot! Barkis and myself had quite a
gossip while you were out with Dick. I know all about it. I don't know where these wretched girls
expect to go to, for my part. I wonder they don't knock out their brains against—against
mantelpieces,” said my aunt; an idea which was probably suggested to her by her contemplation of
mine.</p>
<p>“Poor Emily!” said I.</p>
<p>“Oh, don't talk to me about poor,” returned my aunt. “She should have thought of that, before she
caused so much misery! Give me a kiss, Trot. I am sorry for your early experience.”</p>
<p>As I bent forward, she put her tumbler on my knee to detain me, and said:</p>
<p>“Oh, Trot, Trot! And so you fancy yourself in love! Do you?”</p>
<p>“Fancy, aunt!” I exclaimed, as red as I could be. “I adore her with my whole soul!”</p>
<p>“Dora, indeed!” returned my aunt. “And you mean to say the little thing is very fascinating, I
suppose?”</p>
<p>“My dear aunt,” I replied, “no one can form the least idea what she is!”</p>
<p>“Ah! And not silly?” said my aunt.</p>
<p>“Silly, aunt!”</p>
<pb xml:id="p356"/>
<p>I seriously believe it had never once entered my head for a single moment, to consider whether
she was or not. I resented the idea, of course; but I was in a manner struck by it, as a new one
altogether.</p>
<p>“Not light-headed?” said my aunt.</p>
<p>“Light-headed, aunt!” I could only repeat this daring speculation with the same kind of feeling
with which I had repeated the preceding question.</p>
<p>“Well, well!” said my aunt. “I only ask. I don't depreciate her. Poor little couple! And so you
think you were formed for one another, and are to go through a party-supper-table kind of life, like
two pretty pieces of confectionary, do you, Trot?”</p>
<p>She asked me this so kindly, and with such a gentle air, half playful and half sorrowful, that I
was quite touched.</p>
<p>“We are young and inexperienced, aunt, I know,” I replied; “and I dare say we say and think a
good deal that is rather foolish. But we love one another truly, I am sure. If I thought Dora could
ever love anybody else, or cease to love me; or that I could ever love anybody else, or cease to
love her; I don't know what I should do—go out of my mind, I think!”</p>
<p>“Ah, Trot!” said my aunt, shaking her head, and smiling gravely; “blind, blind, blind!”</p>
<p>“Some one that I know, Trot,” my aunt pursued, after a pause, “though of a very pliant
disposition, has an earnestness of affection in him that reminds me of poor Baby. Earnestness is
what that Somebody must look for, to sustain him and improve him, Trot. Deep, downright, faithful
earnestness.”</p>
<p>“If you only knew the earnestness of Dora, aunt!” I cried.</p>
<p>“Oh, Trot!” she said again; “blind, blind!” and without knowing why, I felt a vague unhappy loss
or want of something overshadow me like a cloud.</p>
<p>“However,” said my aunt, “I don't want to put two young creatures out of conceit with themselves,
or to make them unhappy; so, though it is a girl and boy attachment, and girl and boy attachments
very often—mind! I don't say always!—come to nothing, still we'll be serious about it, and hope for
a prosperous issue one of these days. There's time enough for it to come to anything!”</p>
<p>This was not upon the whole very comforting to a rapturous lover; but I was glad to have my aunt
in my confidence, and I was mindful of her being fatigued. So I thanked her ardently for this mark
of her affection, and for all her other kindnesses towards me; and after a tender good night, she
took her nightcap into my bedroom.</p>
<p>How miserable I was, when I lay down! How I thought and thought about my being poor, in Mr.
Spenlow's eyes; about my not being what I thought I was, when I proposed to Dora; about the
chivalrous necessity of telling Dora what my worldly condition was, and releasing her from her
engagement if she thought fit; about how I should contrive to live, during the long term of my
articles, when I was earning nothing; about doing something to assist my aunt, and seeing no way of
doing anything; about coming down to have no money in my pocket, and to wear a shabby coat, and to
be able to carry Dora no little presents, and to ride no gallant greys, and to show myself in no
agreeable light! Sordid and selfish as I knew it was, and as I tortured myself by knowing that it
was, <pb xml:id="p357"/> to let my mind run on my own distress so much, I was so devoted to Dora
that I could not help it. I knew that it was base in me not to think more of my aunt, and less of
myself; but, so far, selfishness was inseparable from Dora, and I could not put Dora on one side for
any mortal creature. How exceedingly miserable I was, that night!</p>
<p>As to sleep, I had dreams of poverty in all sorts of shapes, but I seemed to dream without the
previous ceremony of going to sleep. Now I was ragged, wanting to sell Dora matches, six bundles for
a halfpenny; now I was at the office in a nightgown and boots, remonstrated with by Mr. Spenlow on
appearing before the clients in that airy attire; now I was hungrily picking up the crumbs that fell
from old Tiffey's daily biscuit, regularly eaten when Saint Paul's struck one; now I was hopelessly
endeavouring to get a license to marry Dora, having nothing but one of Uriah Heep's gloves to offer
in exchange, which the whole Commons rejected; and still, more or less conscious of my own room, I
was always tossing about like a distressed ship in a sea of bed-clothes.</p>
<p>My aunt was restless, too, for I frequently heard her walking to and fro. Two or three times in
the course of the night, attired in a long flannel wrapper in which she looked seven feet high, she
appeared, like a disturbed ghost, in my room, and came to the side of the sofa on which I lay. On
the first occasion I started up in alarm, to learn that she inferred from a particular light in the
sky, that Westminster Abbey was on fire; and to be consulted in reference to the probability of its
igniting Buckingham Street, in case the wind changed. Lying still, after that, I found that she sat
down near me, whispering to herself “Poor boy!” And then it made me twenty times more wretched, to
know how unselfishly mindful she was of me, and how selfishly mindful I was of myself.</p>
<p>It was difficult to believe that a night so long to me, could be short to anybody else. This
consideration set me thinking and thinking of an imaginary party where people were dancing the hours
away, until that became a dream too, and I heard the music incessantly playing one tune, and saw
Dora incessantly dancing one dance, without taking the least notice of me. The man who had been
playing the harp all night, was trying in vain to cover it with an ordinary sized nightcap, when I
awoke; or I should rather say, when I left off trying to go to sleep, and saw the sun shining in
through the window at last.</p>
<p>There was an old Roman bath in those days at the bottom of one of the streets out of the
Strand—it may be there still—in which I have had many a cold plunge. Dressing myself as quietly as I
could, and leaving Peggotty to look after my aunt, I tumbled head foremost into it, and then went
for a walk to Hampstead. I had a hope that this brisk treatment might freshen my wits a little; and
I think it did them good, for I soon came to the conclusion that the first step I ought to take was,
to try if my articles could be cancelled and the premium recovered. I got some breakfast on the
Heath, and walked back to Doctors' Commons, along the watered roads and through a pleasant smell of
summer flowers, growing in gardens and carried into town on hucksters' heads, intent on this first
effort to meet our altered circumstances.</p>
<p>I arrived at the office so soon, after all, that I had half an hour's loitering about the
Commons, before old Tiffey, who was always first, appeared with his key. Then I sat down in my shady
corner, looking up at the sunlight <pb xml:id="p358"/> on the opposite chimney-pots, and thinking
about Dora; until Mr. Spenlow came in, crisp and curly.</p>
<p>“How are you, Copperfield?” said he. “Fine morning!”</p>
<p>“Beautiful morning, sir,” said I. “Could I say a word to you before you go into Court?”</p>
<p>“By all means,” said he. “Come into my room.”</p>
<p>I followed him into his room, and he began putting on his gown, and touching himself up before a
little glass he had, hanging inside a closet door.</p>
<p>“I am sorry to say,” said I, “that I have some rather disheartening intelligence from my
aunt.”</p>
<p>“No!” said he. “Dear me! Not paralysis, I hope?”</p>
<p>“It has no reference to her health, sir,” I replied. “She has met with some large losses. In
fact, she has very little left, indeed.”</p>
<p>“You as-tound me, Copperfield!” cried Mr. Spenlow.</p>
<p>I shook my head. “Indeed, sir,” said I, “her affairs are so changed, that I wished to ask you
whether it would be possible—at a sacrifice on our part of some portion of the premium, of course,”
I put in this, on the spur of the moment, warned by the blank expression of his face—“to cancel my
articles?”</p>
<p>What it cost me to make this proposal, nobody knows. It was like asking, as a favor, to be
sentenced to transportation from Dora.</p>
<p>“To cancel your articles, Copperfield? Cancel?”</p>
<p>I explained with tolerable firmness, that I really did not know where my means of subsistence
were to come from, unless I could earn them for myself. I had no fear for the future, I said—and I
laid great emphasis on that, as if to imply that I should still be decidedly eligible for a
son-in-law one of these days—but, for the present, I was thrown upon my own resources.</p>
<p>“I am extremely sorry to hear this, Copperfield,” said Mr. Spenlow. “Extremely sorry. It is not
usual to cancel articles for any such reason. It is not a professional course of proceeding. It is
not a convenient precedent at all. Far from it. At the same time”—</p>
<p>“You are very good, sir,” I murmured, anticipating a concession.</p>
<p>“Not at all. Don't mention it,” said Mr. Spenlow. “At the same time, I was going to say, if it
had been my lot to have my hands unfettered—if I had not a partner—Mr. Jorkins”—</p>
<p>My hopes were dashed in a moment, but I made another effort.</p>
<p>“Do you think, sir,” said I, “if I were to mention it to Mr. Jorkins—”</p>
<p>Mr. Spenlow shook his head discouragingly. “Heaven forbid, Copperfield,” he replied, “that I
should do any man an injustice; still less, Mr. Jorkins. But I know my partner, Copperfield. Mr.
Jorkins is <hi rend="italics">not</hi> a man to respond to a proposition of this peculiar nature.
Mr. Jorkins is very difficult to move from the beaten track. You know what he is!”</p>
<p>I am sure I knew nothing about him, except that he had originally been alone in the business, and
now lived by himself in a house near Montagu Square, which was fearfully in want of painting; that
he came very late of a day, and went away very early; that he never appeared to be consulted about
anything; and that he had a dingy little black-hole of his own up-stairs, where no business was ever
done, and where there was a yellow old cartridge-paper pad upon his desk, unsoiled by ink, and
reported to be twenty years of age.</p>
<pb xml:id="p359"/>
<p>“Would you object to my mentioning it to him, sir?” I asked.</p>
<p>“By no means,” said Mr. Spenlow. “But I have some experience of Mr. Jorkins, Copperfield. I wish
it were otherwise, for I should be happy to meet your views in any respect. I cannot have the least
objection to your mentioning it to Mr. Jorkins, Copperfield, if you think it worth while.”</p>
<p>Availing myself of this permission, which was given with a warm shake of the hand, I sat thinking
about Dora, and looking at the sunlight stealing from the chimney-pots down the wall of the opposite
house, until Mr. Jorkins came. I then went up to Mr. Jorkins's room, and evidently astonished Mr.
Jorkins very much by making my appearance there.</p>
<p>“Come in, Mr. Copperfield,” said Mr. Jorkins. “Come in!”</p>
<p>I went in, and sat down; and stated my case to Mr. Jorkins pretty much as I had stated it to Mr.
Spenlow. Mr. Jorkins was not by any means the awful creature one might have expected, but a large,
mild, smoothfaced man of sixty, who took so much snuff that there was a tradition in the Commons
that he lived principally on that stimulant, having little room in his system for any other article
of diet.</p>
<p>“You have mentioned this to Mr. Spenlow, I suppose?” said Mr. Jorkins; when he had heard me, very
restlessly, to an end.</p>
<p>I answered Yes, and told him that Mr. Spenlow had introduced his name.</p>
<p>“He said I should object?” asked Mr. Jorkins.</p>
<p>I was obliged to admit that Mr. Spenlow had considered it probable.</p>
<p>“I am sorry to say, Mr. Copperfield, I can't advance your object,” said Mr. Jorkins, nervously.
“The fact is—but I have an appointment at the Bank, if you'll have the goodness to excuse me.”</p>
<p>With that he rose in a great hurry, and was going out of the room, when I made bold to say that I
feared, then, there was no way of arranging the matter?</p>
<p>“No!” said Mr. Jorkins, stopping at the door to shake his head. “Oh, no! I object, you know,”
which he said very rapidly, and went out. “You must be aware, Mr. Copperfield,” he added, looking
restlessly in at the door again, “if Mr. Spenlow objects —”</p>
<p>“Personally, he does not object, sir,” said I.</p>
<p>“Oh! Personally!” repeated Mr. Jorkins, in an impatient manner. “I assure you there's an
objection, Mr. Copperfield. Hopeless! What you wish to be done, can't be done. I—I really have got
an appointment at the Bank.” With that he fairly ran away; and to the best of my knowledge, it was
three days before he showed himself in the Commons again.</p>
<p>Being very anxious to leave no stone unturned, I waited until Mr. Spenlow came in, and then
described what had passed; giving him to understand that I was not hopeless of his being able to
soften the adamantine Jorkins, if he would undertake that task.</p>
<p>“Copperfield,” returned Mr. Spenlow, with a sagacious smile, “you have not known my partner, Mr.
Jorkins, as long as I have. Nothing is farther from my thoughts than to attribute any degree of
artifice to Mr. Jorkins. But Mr. Jorkins has a way of stating his objections which often deceives
people. No, Copperfield!” shaking his head. “Mr. Jorkins is not to be moved, believe me!”</p>
<pb xml:id="p360"/>
<p>I was completely bewildered between Mr. Spenlow and Mr. Jorkins, as to which of them really was
the objecting partner; but I saw with sufficient clearness that there was obduracy somewhere in the
firm, and that the recovery of my aunt's thousand pounds was out of the question. In a state of
despondency, which I remember with anything but satisfaction, for I know it still had too much
reference to myself (though always in connexion with Dora), I left the office, and went
homeward.</p>
<p>I was trying to familiarise my mind with the worst, and to present to myself the arrangements we
should have to make for the future in their sternest aspect, when a hackney chariot coming after me,
and stopping at my very feet, occasioned me to look up. A fair hand was stretched forth to me from
the window; and the face I had never seen without a feeling of serenity and happiness, from the
moment when it first turned back on the old oak staircase with the great broad balustrade, and when
I associated its softened beauty with the stained glass window in the church, was smiling on me.</p>
<p>“Agnes!” I joyfully exclaimed. “Oh, my dear Agnes, of all people in the world, what a pleasure to
see you!”</p>
<p>“Is it, indeed?” she said, in her cordial voice.</p>
<p>“I want to talk to you so much!” said I. “It's such a lightening of my heart, only to look at
you! If I had had a conjuror's cap, there is no one I should have wished for but you!”</p>
<p>“What?” returned Agnes.</p>
<p>“Well! perhaps Dora, first,” I admitted, with a blush.</p>
<p>“Certainly, Dora first, I hope,” said Agnes, laughing.</p>
<p>“But you next!” said I. “Where are you going?”</p>
<p>She was going to my rooms to see my aunt. The day being very fine, she was glad to come out of
the chariot, which smelt (I had my head in it all this time) like a stable put under a
cucumber-frame. I dismissed the coachman, and she took my arm, and we walked on together. She was
like Hope embodied, to me. How different I felt in one short minute, having Agnes at my side!</p>
<p>My aunt had written her one of the odd, abrupt notes—very little longer than a Bank note—to which
her epistolary efforts were usually limited. She had stated therein that she had fallen into
adversity, and was leaving Dover for good, but had quite made up her mind to it, and was so well
that nobody need be uncomfortable about her. Agnes had come to London to see my aunt, between whom
and herself there had been a mutual liking these many years: indeed, it dated from the time of my
taking up my residence in Mr. Wickfield's house. She was not alone, she said. Her papa was with
her—and Uriah Heep.</p>
<p>“And now they are partners,” said I. “Confound him!”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Agnes. “They have some business here; and I took advantage of their coming, to come
too. You must not think my visit all friendly and disinterested, Trotwood, for—I am afraid I may be
cruelly prejudiced—I do not like to let papa go away alone, with him.”</p>
<p>“Does he exercise the same influence over Mr. Wickfield still, Agnes?”</p>
<p>Agnes shook her head. “There is such a change at home,” said she, “that you would scarcely know
the dear old house. They live with us now.”</p>
<p>“They?” said I.</p>
<pb xml:id="p361"/>
<p>“Mr. Heep and his mother. He sleeps in your old room,” said Agnes, looking up into my face.</p>
<p>“I wish I had the ordering of his dreams,” said I. “He wouldn't sleep there long.”</p>
<p>“I keep my own little room,” said Agnes, “where I used to learn my lessons. How the time goes!
You remember? The little panelled room that opens from the drawing-room?”</p>
<p>“Remember, Agnes? When I saw you, for the first time, coming out at the door, with your quaint
little basket of keys hanging at your side?”</p>
<p>“It is just the same,” said Agnes, smiling. “I am glad you think of it so pleasantly. We were
very happy.”</p>
<p>“We were, indeed,” said I.</p>
<p>“I keep that room to myself still; but I cannot always desert Mrs. Heep, you know. And so,” said
Agnes quietly, “I feel obliged to bear her company, when I might prefer to be alone. But I have no
other reason to complain of her. If she tires me, sometimes, by her praises of her son, it is only
natural in a mother. He is a very good son to her.”</p>
<p>I looked at Agnes when she said these words, without detecting in her any consciousness of
Uriah's design. Her mild but earnest eyes met mine with their own beautiful frankness, and there was
no change in her gentle face.</p>
<p>“The chief evil of their presence in the house,” said Agnes, “is that I cannot be as near papa as
I could wish—Uriah Heep being so much between us—and cannot watch over him, if that is not too bold
a thing to say, as closely as I would. But, if any fraud or treachery is practising against him, I
hope that simple love and truth will be stronger, in the end. I hope that real love and truth are
stronger in the end than any evil or misfortune in the world.”</p>
<p>A certain bright smile which I never saw on any other face, died away, even while I thought how
good it was, and how familiar it had once been to me; and she asked me, with a quick change of
expression (we were drawing very near my street), if I knew how the reverse in my aunt's
circumstances had been brought about. On my replying no, she had not told me yet, Agnes became
thoughtful, and I fancied I felt her arm tremble in mine.</p>
<p>We found my aunt alone, in a state of some excitement. A difference of opinion had arisen between
herself and Mrs. Crupp, on an abstract question (the propriety of chambers being inhabited by the
gentler sex); and my aunt, utterly indifferent to spasms on the part of Mrs. Crupp, had cut the
dispute short, by informing that lady that she smelt of my brandy, and that she would trouble her to
walk out. Both of these expressions Mrs. Crupp considered actionable, and had expressed her
intention of bringing before a “British Judy”—meaning, it was supposed, the bulwark of our national
liberties.</p>
<p>My aunt, however, having had time to cool, while Peggotty was out showing Mr. Dick the soldiers
at the Horse Guards—and being, besides, greatly pleased to see Agnes—rather plumed herself on the
affair than otherwise, and received us with unimpaired good humour. When Agnes laid her bonnet on
the table, and sat down beside her, I could not but think, looking on her mild eyes and her radiant
forehead, how natural it <pb xml:id="p362"/> seemed to have her there; how trustfully, although she
was so young and inexperienced, my aunt confided in her; how strong she was, indeed, in simple love
and truth.</p>
<p>We began to talk about my aunt's losses, and I told them what I had tried to do that morning.</p>
<p>“Which was injudicious, Trot,” said my aunt, “but well meant. You are a generous boy—I suppose I
must say, young man, now—and I am proud of you, my dear. So far, so good. Now, Trot and Agnes, let
us look the case of Betsey Trotwood in the face, and see how it stands.”</p>
<p>I observed Agnes turn pale, as she looked very attentively at my aunt. My aunt, patting her cat,
looked very attentively at Agnes.</p>
<p>“Betsey Trotwood,” said my aunt, “who had always kept her money matters to herself: “—I don't
mean your sister, Trot, my dear, but myself—had a certain property. It don't matter how much; enough
to live on. More; for she had saved a little, and added to it. Betsey funded her property for some
time, and then, by the advice of her man of business, laid it out on landed security. That did very
well, and returned very good interest, till Betsey was paid off. I am talking of Betsey as if she
was a man-of-war. Well! Then, Betsey had to look about her, for a new investment. She thought she
was wiser, now, than her man of business, who was not such a good man of business by this time, as
he used to be—I am alluding to your father, Agnes—and she took it into her head to lay it out for
herself. So she took her pigs,” said my aunt, “to a foreign market; and a very bad market it turned
out to be. First, she lost in the mining way, and then she lost in the diving way—fishing up
treasure, or some such Tom Tidler nonsense,” explained my aunt, rubbing her nose; “and then she lost
in the mining way again, and, last of all, to set the thing entirely to rights, she lost in the
banking way. I don't know what the Bank shares were worth for a little while,” said my aunt; “cent
per cent was the lowest of it, I believe; but the Bank was at the other end of the world, and
tumbled into space, for what I know; anyhow, it fell to pieces, and never will and never can pay
sixpence; and Betsey's sixpences were all there, and there's an end of them. Least said, soonest
mended!”</p>
<p>My aunt concluded this philosophical summary, by fixing her eyes with a kind of triumph on Agnes,
whose color was gradually returning.</p>
<p>“Dear Miss Trotwood, is that all the history?” said Agnes.</p>
<p>“I hope it's enough, child,” said my aunt. “If there had been more money to lose, it wouldn't
have been all, I dare say. Betsey would have contrived to throw that after the rest, and make
another chapter, I have little doubt. But, there was no more money, and there's no more story.”</p>
<p>Agnes had listened at first with suspended breath. Her color still came and went, but she
breathed more freely. I thought I knew why. I thought she had had some fear that her unhappy father
might be in some way to blame for what had happened. My aunt took her hand in hers, and laughed.</p>
<p>“Is that all?” repeated my aunt. “Why, yes, that's all, except, ‘And she lived happy ever
afterwards.’ Perhaps I may add that of Betsey yet, one of these days. Now, Agnes, you have a wise
head. So have you, Trot, in some things, though I can't compliment you always;” and here my aunt
shook her own at me, with an energy peculiar to herself. “What's to be done? Here's the cottage,
taking one time with <pb xml:id="p363"/> another, will produce, say seventy pounds a-year. I think
we may safely put it down at that. Well!—That's all we've got,” said my aunt; with whom it was an
idiosyncrasy, as it is with some horses, to stop very short when she appeared to be in a fair way of
going on for a long while.</p>
<p>“Then,” said my aunt, after a rest, “there's Dick. He's good for a hundred a-year, but of course
that must be expended on himself. I would sooner send him away, though I know I am the only person
who appreciates him, than have him, and not spend his money on himself. How can Trot and I do best,
upon our means? What do you say, Agnes?”</p>
<p>“<hi rend="italics">I</hi> say, aunt,” I interposed, “that I must do something!”</p>
<p>“Go for a soldier, do you mean?” returned my aunt, alarmed; “or go to sea? I won't hear of it.
You are to be a proctor. We're not going to have any knockings on the head in <hi rend="italics"
>this</hi> family, if you please, sir.”</p>
<p>I was about to explain that I was not desirous of introducing that mode of provision into the
family, when Agnes inquired if my rooms were held for any long term?</p>
<p>“You come to the point, my dear,” said my aunt. “They are not to be got rid of, for six months at
least, unless they could be underlet, and that I don't believe. The last man died here. Five people
out of six <hi rend="italics">would</hi> die—of course—of that woman in nankeen with the flannel
petticoat. I have a little ready money; and I agree with you, the best thing we can do, is, to live
the term out here, and get Dick a bed-room hard by.”</p>
<p>I thought it my duty to hint at the discomfort my aunt would sustain, from living in a continual
state of guerilla warfare with Mrs. Crupp; but she disposed of that objection summarily by
declaring, that, on the first demonstration of hostilities, she was prepared to astonish Mrs. Crupp
for the whole remainder of her natural life.</p>
<p>“I have been thinking, Trotwood,” said Agnes, diffidently, “that if you had time—”</p>
<p>“I have a good deal of time, Agnes. I am always disengaged after four or five o'clock, and I have
time early in the morning. In one way and another,” said I, conscious of reddening a little as I
thought of the hours and hours I had devoted to fagging about town, and to and fro upon the Norwood
Road, “I have abundance of time.”</p>
<p>“I know you would not mind,” said Agnes, coming to me, and speaking in a low voice, so full of
sweet and hopeful consideration that I hear it now, “the duties of a secretary.”</p>
<p>“Mind, my dear Agnes?”</p>
<p>“Because,” continued Agnes, “Doctor Strong has acted on his intention of retiring, and has come
to live in London; and he asked papa, I know, if he could recommend him one. Don't you think he
would rather have his favorite old pupil near him, than anybody else?”</p>
<p>“Dear Agnes!” said I. “What should I do without you! You are always my good angel. I told you so.
I never think of you in any other light.”</p>
<p>Agnes answered with her pleasant laugh, that one good angel (meaning Dora) was enough; and went
on to remind me that the Doctor had been used to occupy himself in his study, early in the morning,
and in the evening—and that probably my leisure would suit his requirements very well. I was
scarcely more delighted with the prospect of earning my <pb xml:id="p364"/> own bread, than with the
hope of earning it under my old master; in short, acting on the advice of Agnes, I sat down and
wrote a letter to the Doctor, stating my object, and appointing to call on him next day at ten in
the forenoon. This I addressed to Highgate—for in that place, so memorable to me, he lived—and went
out and posted, myself, without losing a minute.</p>
<p>Wherever Agnes was, some agreeable token of her noiseless presence seemed inseparable from the
place. When I came back, I found my aunt's birds hanging, just as they had hung so long in the
parlor window of the cottage; and my easy chair imitating my aunt's much easier chair in its
position at the open window; and even the round green fan, which my aunt had brought away with her,
screwed on to the window-sill. I knew who had done all this, by its seeming to have quietly done
itself; and I should have known in a moment who had arranged my neglected books in the old order of
my school days, even if I had supposed Agnes to be miles away, instead of seeing her busy with them,
and smiling at the disorder into which they had fallen.</p>
<p>My aunt was quite gracious on the subject of the Thames (it really did look very well with the
sun upon it, though not like the sea before the cottage), but she could not relent towards the
London smoke, which, she said, “peppered everything.” A complete revolution, in which Peggotty bore
a prominent part, was being effected in every corner of my rooms, in regard of this pepper; and I
was looking on, thinking how little even Peggotty seemed to do with a good deal of bustle, and how
much Agues did without any bustle at all, when a knock came at the door.</p>
<p>“I think,” said Agnes, turning pale, “it's papa. He promised me that he would come.”</p>
<p>I opened the door, and admitted, not only Mr. Wickfield, but Uriah Heep. I had not seen Mr.
Wickfield for some time. I was prepared for a great change in him, after what I had heard from
Agnes, but his appearance shocked me.</p>
<p>It was not that he looked many years older, though still dressed with the old scrupulous
cleanliness; or that there was an unwholesome ruddiness upon his face; or that his eyes were full
and bloodshot; or that there was a nervous trembling in his hand, the cause of which I knew, and had
for some years seen at work. It was not that he had lost his good looks, or his old bearing of a
gentleman—for that he had not—but the thing that struck me most, was, that with the evidences of his
native superiority still upon him, he should submit himself to that crawling impersonation of
meanness, Uriah Heep. The reversal of the two natures, in their relative positions, Uriah's of power
and Mr. Wickfield's of dependence, was a sight more painful to me than I can express. If I had seen
an Ape taking command of a Man, I should hardly have thought it a more degrading spectacle.</p>
<p>He appeared to be only too conscious of it himself. When he came in, he stood still; and with his
head bowed, as if he felt it. This was only for a moment; for Agnes softly said to him, “Papa! Here
is Miss Trotwood—and Trotwood, whom you have not seen for a long while!” and then he approached, and
constrainedly gave my aunt his hand, and shook hands more cordially with me. In the moment's pause I
speak of, I saw Uriah's countenance form itself into a most ill-favored smile. Agnes saw it too, I
think, for she shrank from him.</p>
<pb xml:id="p365"/>
<p>What my aunt saw, or did not see, I defy the science of physiognomy to have made out, without her
own consent. I believe there never was anybody with such an imperturbable countenance when she
chose. Her face might have been a dead wall on the occasion in question, for any light it threw upon
her thoughts; until she broke silence with her usual abruptness.</p>
<p>“Well, Wickfield!” said my aunt; and he looked up at her for the first time. “I have been telling
your daughter how well I have been disposing of my money for myself, because I couldn't trust it to
you, as you were growing rusty in business matters. We have been taking counsel together, and
getting on very well, all things considered. Agnes is worth the whole firm, in my opinion.”</p>
<p>“If I may umbly make the remark,” said Uriah Heep, with a writhe, “I fully agree with Miss Betsey
Trotwood, and should be only too appy if Miss Agnes was a partner.”</p>
<p>“You're a partner yourself, you know,” returned my aunt, “and that's about enough for you, I
expect. How do you find yourself, sir?”</p>
<p>In acknowledgment of this question, addressed to him with extraordinary curtness, Mr. Heep,
uncomfortably clutching the blue bag he carried, replied that he was pretty well, he thanked my
aunt, and hoped she was the same.</p>
<p>“And you, Master—I should say, Mister Copperfield,” pursued Uriah. “I hope I see you well! I am
rejoiced to see you, Mister Copperfield, even under present circumstances.” I believed that; for he
seemed to relish them very much. “Present circumstances is not what your friends would wish for you,
Mister Copperfield, but it isn't money makes the man: it's—I am really unequal with my umble powers
to express what it is,” said Uriah, with a fawning jerk, “but it isn't money!”</p>
<p>Here he shook hands with me: not in the common way, but standing at a good distance from me, and
lifting my hand up and down like a pump handle, that he was a little afraid of.</p>
<p>“And how do you think we are looking, Master Copperfield,—I should say, Mister?” fawned Uriah.
“Don't you find Mr. Wickfield blooming, sir? Years don't tell much in our firm, Master Copperfield,
except in raising up the umble, namely, mother and self—and in developing,” he added as an
after-thought, “the beautiful, namely Miss Agnes.”</p>
<p>He jerked himself about, after this compliment, in such an intolerable manner, that my aunt, who
had sat looking straight at him, lost all patience.</p>
<p>“Deuce take the man!” said my aunt, sternly, “what's he about? Don't be galvanic, sir!”</p>
<p>“I ask your pardon, Miss Trotwood,” returned Uriah; “I'm aware you're nervous.”</p>
<p>“Go along with you, sir!” said my aunt, anything but appeased. “Don't presume to say so! I am
nothing of the sort. If you're an eel, sir, conduct yourself like one. If you're a man, control your
limbs, sir! Good God!” said my aunt, with great indignation, “I am not going to be serpentined and
corkscrewed out of my senses!”</p>
<p>Mr. Heep was rather abashed, as most people might have been, by this explosion; which derived
great additional force from the indignant manner in which my aunt afterwards moved in her chair, and
shook her <pb xml:id="p366"/> head as if she were making snaps or bounces at him. But, he said to me
aside in a meek voice:</p>
<p>“I am well aware, Master Copperfield, that Miss Trotwood, though an excellent lady, has a quick
temper (indeed I think I had the pleasure of knowing her, when I was a numble clerk, before you did,
Master Copperfield), and it's only natural, I am sure, that it should be made quicker by present
circumstances. The wonder is, that it isn't much worse! I only called to say that if there was
anything we could do, in present circumstances, mother or self, or Wickfield and Heep, we should be
really glad. I may go so far?” said Uriah, with a sickly smile at his partner.</p>
<p>“Uriah Heep,” said Mr. Wickfield, in a monotonous forced way, “is active in the business,
Trotwood. What he says, I quite concur in. You know I had an old interest in you. Apart from that,
what Uriah says I quite concur in!”</p>
<p>“Oh, what a reward it is,” said Uriah, drawing up one <choice xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">
<sic>leg,at</sic>
<corr>leg, at</corr>
</choice> the risk of bringing down upon himself another visitation from my aunt, “to be so trusted
in! But I hope I am able to do something to relieve him from the fatigues of business, Master
Copperfield!”</p>
<p>“Uriah Heep is a great relief to me,” said Mr. Wickfield, in the same dull voice. “It's a load
off my mind, Trotwood, to have such a partner.”</p>
<p>The red fox made him say all this, I knew, to exhibit him to me in the light he had indicated on
the night when he poisoned my rest. I saw the same ill-favored smile upon his face again, and saw
how he watched me.</p>
<p>“You are not going, papa?” said Agnes, anxiously. “Will you not walk back with Trotwood and
me?”</p>
<p>He would have looked to Uriah, I believe, before replying, if that worthy had not anticipated
him.</p>
<p>“I am bespoke myself,” said Uriah, “on business; otherwise I should have been appy to have kept
with my friends. But I leave my partner to represent the firm. Miss Agnes, ever yours! I wish you
good-day, Master Copperfield, and leave my umble respects for Miss Betsey Trotwood.”</p>
<p>With those words, he retired, kissing his great hand, and leering at us like a mask.</p>
<p>We sat there, talking about our pleasant old Canterbury days, an hour or two. Mr. Wickfield, left
to Agnes, soon became more like his former self; though there was a settled depression upon him,
which he never shook off. For all that, he brightened; and had an evident pleasure in hearing us
recall the little incidents of our old life, many of which he remembered very well. He said it was
like those times, to be alone with Agnes and me again; and he wished to Heaven they had never
changed. I am sure there was an influence in the placid face of Agnes, and in the very touch of her
hand upon his arm, that did wonders for him.</p>
<p>My aunt (who was busy nearly all this while with Peggotty, in the inner room) would not accompany
us to the place where they were staying, but insisted on my going; and I went. We dined together.
After dinner, Agnes sat beside him, as of old, and poured out his wine. He took what she gave him,
and no more—like a child—and we all three sat together at a window as the evening gathered in. When
it was almost dark, he lay down on a sofa, Agnes pillowing his head and bending over him a little
while; and when she came back to the window, it was not so dark but I could see tears glittering in
her eyes.</p>
<pb xml:id="p367"/>
<p>I pray Heaven that I never may forget the dear girl in her love and truth, at that time of my
life; for if I should, I must be drawing near the end, and then I would desire to remember her best!
She filled my heart with such good resolutions, strengthened my weakness so, by her example, so
directed—I know not how, she was too modest and gentle to advise me in many words—the wandering
ardor and unsettled purpose within me, that all the little good I have done, and all the harm I have
forborne, I solemnly believe I may refer to her.</p>
<p>And how she spoke to me of Dora, sitting at the window in the dark; listened to my praises of
her; praised again; and round the little fairy-figure shed some glimpses of her own pure light, that
made it yet more precious and more innocent to me! Oh, Agnes, sister of my boyhood, if I had known
then, what I knew long afterwards!—</p>
<p>There was a beggar in the street, when I went down; and as I turned my head towards the window,
thinking of her calm, seraphic eyes, he made me start by muttering, as if he were an echo of the
morning:</p>
<p>“Blind! Blind! Blind!”</p>

<div type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER XXXVI.
<lb/> ENTHUSIASM.</head>
<p>I BEGAN the next day with another dive into the Roman bath, and then started for Highgate. I was
not dispirited now. I was not afraid of the shabby coat, and had no yearnings after gallant greys.
My whole manner of thinking of our late misfortune was changed. What I had to do, was, to show my
aunt that her past goodness to me had not been thrown away on an insensible, ungrateful object. What
I had to do, was, to turn the painful discipline of my younger days to account, by going to work
with a resolute and steady heart. What I had to do, was, to take my woodman's axe in my hand, and
clear my own way through the forest of difficulty, by cutting down the trees until I came to Dora.
And I went on at a mighty rate, as if it could be done by walking.</p>
<p>When I found myself on the familiar Highgate road, pursuing such a different errand from that old
one of pleasure, with which it was associated, it seemed as if a complete change had come on my
whole life. But that did not discourage me. With the new life, came new purpose, new intention.
Great was the labor; priceless the reward. Dora was the reward, and Dora must be won.</p>
<p>I got into such a transport, that I felt quite sorry my coat was not a little shabby already. I
wanted to be cutting at those trees in the forest of difficulty, under circumstances that should
prove my strength. I had a good mind to ask an old man, in wire spectacles, who was breaking stones
upon the road, to lend me his hammer for a little while, and let me begin to beat a path to Dora out
of granite. I stimulated myself into such a heat, and got so out of breath, that I felt as if I had
been earning <pb xml:id="p368"/> I don't know how much. In this state, I went into a cottage that I
saw was to let, and examined it narrowly,—for I felt it necessary to be practical. It would do for
me and Dora admirably: with a little front garden for Jip to run about in, and bark at the
tradespeople through the railings, and a capital room up-stairs for my aunt. I came out again,
hotter and faster than ever, and dashed up to Highgate, at such a rate that I was there an hour too
early; and, though I had not been, should have been obliged to stroll about to cool myself, before I
was at all presentable.</p>
<p>My first care, after putting myself under this necessary course of preparation, was to find the
Doctor's house. It was not in that part of Highgate where Mrs. Steerforth lived, but quite on the
opposite side of the little town. When I had made this discovery, I went back, in an attraction I
could not resist, to a lane by Mrs. Steerforth's, and looked over the corner of the garden wall. His
room was shut up close. The conservatory doors were standing open, and Rosa Dartle was walking,
bareheaded, with a quick, impetuous step, up and down a gravel walk on one side of the lawn. She
gave me the idea of some fierce thing, that was dragging the length of its chain to and fro upon a
beaten track, and wearing its heart out.</p>
<p>I came softly away from my place of observation, and avoiding that part of the neighbourhood, and
wishing I had not gone near it, strolled about until it was ten o'clock. The church with the slender
spire, that stands on the top of the hill now, was not there then to tell me the time. An old
red-brick mansion, used as a school, was in its place; and a fine old house it must have been to go
to school at, as I recollect it.</p>
<p>When I approached the Doctor's cottage—a pretty old place, on which he seemed to have expended
some money, if I might judge from the embellishments and repairs that had the look of being just
completed—I saw him walking in the garden at the side, gaiters and all, as if he had never left off
walking since the days of my pupilage. He had his old companions about him, too; for there were
plenty of high trees in the neighbourhood, and too or three rooks were on the grass, looking after
him, as if they had been written to about him by the Canterbury rooks, and were observing him
closely in consequence.</p>
<p>Knowing the utter hopelessness of attracting his attention from that distance, I made bold to
open the gate, and walk after him, so as to meet him when he should turn round. When he did, and
came towards me, he looked at me thoughtfully for a few moments, evidently without thinking about me
at all; and then his benevolent face expressed extraordinary pleasure, and he took me by both
hands.</p>
<p>“Why, my dear Copperfield,” said the Doctor; “you are a man! How do you do? I am delighted to see
you. My dear Copperfield, how very much you have improved! You are quite—yes—dear me!”</p>
<p>I hoped he was well, and Mrs. Strong too.</p>
<p>“Oh dear, yes!” said the Doctor; “Annie's quite well, and she'll be delighted to see you. You
were always her favorite. She said so, last night, when I showed her your letter. And—yes to be
sure—you recollect Mr. Jack Maldon, Copperfield?”</p>
<p>“Perfectly, sir.”</p>
<p>“Of course,” said the Doctor. “To be sure. <hi rend="italics">He's</hi> pretty well, too.”</p>
<p>“Has he come home, sir?” I inquired.</p>
<pb xml:id="p369"/>
<p>“From India?” said the Doctor. “Yes. Mr. Jack Maldon couldn't bear the climate, my dear. Mrs.
Markleham—you have not forgotten Mrs. Markleham?”</p>
<p>Forgotten the Old Soldier! And in that short time!</p>
<p>“Mrs. Markleham,” said the Doctor, “was quite vexed about him, poor thing; so we have got him at
home again; and we have bought him a little Patent place, which agrees with him much better.”</p>
<p>I knew enough of Mr. Jack Maldon to suspect from this account that it was a place where there was
not much to do, and which was pretty well paid. The Doctor, walking up and down with his hand on my
shoulder, and his kind face turned encouragingly to mine, went on:</p>
<p>“Now, my dear Copperfield, in reference to this proposal of yours. It's very gratifying and
agreeable to me, I am sure; but don't you think you could do better? You achieved distinction, you
know, when you were with us. You are qualified for many good things. You have laid a foundation that
any edifice may be raised upon; and is it not a pity that you should devote the spring-time of your
life to such a poor pursuit as I can offer?”</p>
<p>I became very glowing again, and, expressing myself in a rhapsodical style, I am afraid, urged my
request strongly; reminding the Doctor that I had already a profession.</p>
<p>“Well, well,” returned the Doctor, “that's true. Certainly, your having a profession, and being
actually engaged in studying it, makes a difference. But, my good young friend, what's seventy
pounds a-year?’</p>
<p>“It doubles our income, Doctor Strong,” said I.</p>
<p>“Dear me!” replied the Doctor. “To think of that! Not that I mean to say it's rigidly limited to
seventy pounds a-year, because I have always contemplated making any young friend I might thus
employ, a present too. Undoubtedly,” said the Doctor, still walking me up and down with his hand on
my shoulder, “I have always taken an annual present into account.”</p>
<p>“My dear tutor,” said I (now, really, without any nonsense), “to whom I owe more obligations
already than I ever can acknowledge—”</p>
<p>“No, no,” interposed the Doctor. “Pardon me!”</p>
<p>“If you will take such time as I have, and that is my mornings and evenings, and can think it
worth seventy pounds a-year, you will do me such a service as I cannot express.”</p>
<p>“Dear me!” said the Doctor, innocently. “To think that so little should go for so much! Dear,
dear! And when you can do better, you will? On your word, now?” said the Doctor,—which he had always
made a very grave appeal to the honor of us boys.</p>
<p>“On my word, sir!” I returned, answering in our old school manner.</p>
<p>“Then be it so!” said the Doctor, clapping me on the shoulder, and still keeping his hand there,
as we still walked up and down.</p>
<p>“And I shall be twenty times happier, sir,” said I, with a little—I hope innocent—flattery, “if
my employment is to be on the Dictionary.”</p>
<p>The Doctor stopped, smilingly clapped me on the shoulder again, and exclaimed, with a triumph
most delightful to behold, as if I had penetrated to the profoundest depths of mortal sagacity, “My
dear young friend, you have hit it. It IS the Dictionary!”</p>
<pb xml:id="p370"/>
<p>How could it be anything else! His pockets were as full of it as his head. It was sticking out of
him in all directions. He told me that since his retirement from scholastic life, he had been
advancing with it wonderfully; and that nothing could suit him better than the proposed arrangements
for morning and evening work, as it was his custom to walk about in the day-time with his
considering cap on. His papers were in a little confusion, in consequence of Mr. Jack Maldon having
lately proffered his occasional services as an amanuensis, and not being accustomed to that
occupation; but we should soon put right what was amiss, and go on swimmingly. Afterwards, when we
were fairly at our work, I found Mr. Jack Maldon's efforts more troublesome to me than I had
expected, as he had not confined himself to making numerous mistakes, but had sketched so many
soldiers, and ladies' heads, over the Doctor's manuscript, that I often became involved in
labyrinths of obscurity.</p>
<p>The Doctor was quite happy in the prospect of our going to work together on that wonderful
performance, and we settled to begin next morning at seven o'clock. We were to work two hours every
morning, and two or three hours every night, except on Saturdays, when I was to rest. On Sundays, of
course, I was to rest also, and I considered these very easy terms.</p>
<p>Our plans being thus arranged to our mutual satisfaction, the Doctor took me into the house to
present me to Mrs. Strong, whom we found in the Doctor's new study, dusting his books,—a freedom
which he never permitted anybody else to take with those sacred favorites.</p>
<p>They had postponed their breakfast on my account, and we sat down to table together. We had not
been seated long, when I saw an approaching arrival in Mrs. Strong's face, before I heard any sound
of it. A gentleman on horseback came to the gate, and, leading his horse into the little court, with
the bridle over his arm, as if he were quite at home, tied him to a ring in the empty coach-house
wall, and came into the breakfast parlor, whip in hand. It was Mr. Jack Maldon; and Mr. Jack Maldon
was not at all improved by India, I thought. I was in a state of ferocious virtue, however, as to
young men who were not cutting down the trees in the forest of difficulty; and my impression must be
received with due allowance.</p>
<p>“Mr. Jack!” said the Doctor, “Copperfield!”</p>
<p>Mr. Jack Maldon shook hands with me; but not very warmly, I believed; and with an air of languid
patronage, at which I secretly took great umbrage. But his languor altogether was quite a wonderful
sight; except when he addressed himself to his cousin Annie.</p>
<p>“Have you breakfasted this morning, Mr. Jack?” said the Doctor.</p>
<p>“I hardly ever take breakfast, sir,” he replied, with his head thrown back in an easy chair. “I
find it bores me.”</p>
<p>“Is there any news to-day?” inquired the Doctor.</p>
<p>“Nothing at all, sir,” replied Mr. Maldon. “There's an account about the people being hungry and
discontented down in the North, but they are always being hungry and discontented somewhere.”</p>
<p>The Doctor looked grave, and said, as though he wished to change the subject, “Then there's no
news at all; and no news, they say, is good news.”</p>
<p>“There's a long statement in the papers, sir, about a murder,” observed Mr. Maldon. “But somebody
is always being murdered, and I didn't read it.”</p>
<pb xml:id="p371"/>
<p>A display of indifference to all the actions and passions of mankind was not supposed to be such
a distinguished quality at that time, I think, as I have observed it to be considered since. I have
known it very fashionable indeed. I have seen it displayed with such success, that I have
encountered some fine ladies and gentlemen who might as well have been born caterpillars. Perhaps it
impressed me the more then, because it was new to me, but it certainly did not tend to exalt my
opinion of, or to strengthen my confidence in, Mr. Jack Maldon.</p>
<p>“I came out to inquire whether Annie would like to go to the opera to-night,” said Mr. Maldon,
turning to her. “It's the last good night there will be, this season; and there's a singer there,
whom she really ought to hear. She is perfectly exquisite. Besides which, she is so charmingly
ugly,” relapsing into languor.</p>
<p>The Doctor, ever pleased with what was likely to please his young wife, turned to her and
said:</p>
<p>“You must go, Annie. You must go.”</p>
<p>“I would rather not,” she said to the Doctor. “I prefer to remain at home. I would much rather
remain at home.”</p>
<p>Without looking at her cousin, she then addressed me, and asked me about Agnes, and whether she
should see her, and whether she was not likely to come that day; and was so much disturbed, that I
wondered how even the Doctor, buttering his toast, could be blind to what was so obvious.</p>
<p>But he saw nothing. He told her, good-naturedly, that she was young and ought to be amused and
entertained, and must not allow herself to be made dull by a dull old fellow. Moreover, he said, he
wanted to hear her sing all the new singer's songs to him; and how could she do that well, unless
she went? So the Doctor persisted in making the engagement for her, and Mr. Jack Maldon was to come
back to dinner. This concluded, he went to his Patent place, I suppose; but at all events went away
on his horse, looking very idle.</p>
<p>I was curious to find out next morning, whether she had been. She had not, but had sent into
London to put her cousin off; and had gone out in the afternoon to see Agnes, and had prevailed upon
the Doctor to go with her; and they had walked home by the fields, the Doctor told me, the evening
being delightful. I wondered then, whether she would have gone if Agnes had not been in town, and
whether Agnes had some good influence over her too!</p>
<p>She did not look very happy, I thought; but it was a good face, or a very false one. I often
glanced at it, for she sat in the window all the time we were at work; and made our breakfast, which
we took by snatches as we were employed. When I left, at nine o'clock, she was kneeling on the
ground at the Doctor's feet, putting on his shoes and gaiters for him. There was a softened shade
upon her face, thrown from some green leaves overhanging the open window of the low room; and I
thought all the way to Doctors' Commons, of the night when I had seen it looking at him as he
read.</p>
<p>I was pretty busy now; up at five in the morning, and home at nine or ten at night. But I had
infinite satisfaction in being so closely engaged, and never walked slowly on any account, and felt
enthusiastically that the <pb xml:id="p372"/> more I tired myself, the more I was doing to deserve
Dora. I had not revealed myself in my altered character to Dora yet, because she was coming to see
Miss Mills in a few days, and I deferred all I had to tell her until then; merely informing her in
my letters (all our communications were secretly forwarded through Miss Mills), that I had much to
tell her. In the meantime, I put myself on a short allowance of bear's grease, wholly abandoned
scented soap and lavender water, and sold off three waistcoats at a prodigious sacrifice, as being
too luxurious for my stern career.</p>
<p>Not satisfied with all these proceedings, but burning with impatience to do something more, I
went to see Traddles, now lodging up behind the parapet of a house in Castle Street, Holborn. Mr.
Dick, who had been with me to Highgate twice already, and had resumed his companionship with the
Doctor, I took with me.</p>
<p>I took Mr. Dick with me, because, acutely sensitive to my aunt's reverses, and sincerely
believing that no galley-slave or convict worked as I did, he had begun to fret and worry himself
out of spirits and appetite, as having nothing useful to do. In this condition, he felt more
incapable of finishing the Memorial than ever; and the harder he worked at it, the oftener that
unlucky head of King Charles the First got into it. Seriously apprehending that his malady would
increase, unless we put some innocent deception upon him and caused him to believe that he was
useful, or unless we could put him in the way of being really useful (which would be better), I made
up my mind to try if Traddles could help us. Before we went, I wrote Traddles a full statement of
all that had happened, and Traddles wrote me back a capital answer, expressive of his sympathy and
friendship.</p>
<p>We found him hard at work with his inkstand and papers, refreshed by the sight of the
flowerpot-stand and the little round table in a corner of the small apartment. He received us
cordially, and made friends with Mr. Dick in a moment. Mr. Dick professed an absolute certainty of
having seen him before, and we both said, “Very likely.”</p>
<p>The first subject on which I had to consult Traddles was this.—I had heard that many men
distinguished in various pursuits had begun life by reporting the debates in Parliament. Traddles
having mentioned newspapers to me, as one of his hopes, I had put the two things together, and told
Traddles in my letter that I wished to know how I could qualify myself for this pursuit. Traddles
now informed me, as the result of his inquiries, that the mere mechanical acquisition necessary,
except in rare cases, for thorough excellence in it, that is to say, a perfect and entire command of
the mystery of short-hand writing and reading, was about equal in difficulty to the mastery of six
languages; and that it might perhaps be attained, by dint of perseverance, in the course of a few
years. Traddles reasonably supposed that this would settle the business; but I, only feeling that
here indeed were a few tall trees to be hewn down, immediately resolved to work my way on to Dora
through this thicket, axe in hand.</p>
<p>“I am very much obliged to you, my dear Traddles!” said I. “I'll begin to-morrow.”</p>
<p>Traddles looked astonished, as he well might; but he had no notion as yet of my rapturous
condition.</p>
<pb xml:id="p373"/>
<p>“I'll buy a book,” said I, “with a good scheme of this art in it; I'll work at it at the Commons,
where I haven't half enough to do; I'll take down the speeches in our court for practice—Traddles,
my dear fellow, I'll master it!”</p>
<p>“Dear me,” said Traddles, opening his eyes, “I had no idea you were such a determined character,
Copperfield!”</p>
<p>I don't know how he should have had, for it was new enough to me. I passed that off, and brought
Mr. Dick on the carpet.</p>
<p>“You see,” said Mr. Dick, wistfully, “if I could exert myself, Mr. Traddles—if I could beat a
drum—or blow anything!”</p>
<p>Poor fellow! I have little doubt he would have preferred such an employment in his heart to all
others. Traddles, who would not have smiled for the world, replied composedly:</p>
<p>“But you are a very good penman, sir. You told me so, Copperfield?”</p>
<p>“Excellent!” said I. And indeed he was. He wrote with extraordinary neatness.</p>
<p>“Don't you think,” said Traddles, “you could copy writings, sir, if I got them for you?”</p>
<p>Mr. Dick looked doubtfully at me. “Eh, Trotwood?”</p>
<p>I shook my head. Mr. Dick shook his, and sighed. “Tell him about the Memorial,” said Mr.
Dick.</p>
<p>I explained to Traddles that there was a difficulty in keeping King Charles the First out of Mr.
Dick's manuscripts; Mr. Dick in the meanwhile looking very deferentially and seriously at Traddles,
and sucking his thumb.</p>
<p>“But these writings, you know, that I speak of, are already drawn up and finished,” said Traddles
after a little consideration. “Mr. Dick has nothing to do with them. Wouldn't that make a
difference, Copperfield? At all events wouldn't it be well to try?”</p>
<p>This gave us new hope. Traddles and I laying our heads together apart, while Mr. Dick anxiously
watched us from his chair, we concocted a scheme in virtue of which we got him to work next day,
with triumphant success.</p>
<p>On a table by the window in Buckingham Street, we set out the work Traddles procured for
him—which was to make, I forget how many copies of a legal document about some right of way—and on
another table we spread the last unfinished original of the great Memorial. Our instructions to Mr.
Dick were that he should copy exactly what he had before him, without the least departure from the
original; and that when he felt it necessary to make the slightest allusion to King Charles the
First, he should fly to the Memorial. We exhorted him to be resolute in this, and left my aunt to
observe him. My aunt reported to us, afterwards, that, at first, he was like a man playing the
kettle-drums, and constantly divided his attentions between the two; but that, finding this confuse
and fatigue him, and having his copy there, plainly before his eyes, he soon sat at it in an orderly
business-like manner, and postponed the Memorial to a more convenient time. In a word, although we
took great care that he should have no more to do than was good for him, and although he did not
begin with the beginning of a week, he earned by the following Saturday night ten shillings and nine
pence; and never, while I live, shall I forget his going about to all the shops in the neighbourhood
<pb xml:id="p374"/> to change this treasure into sixpences, or his bringing them to my aunt arranged
in the form of a heart upon a waiter, with tears of joy and pride in his eyes. He was like one under
the propitious influence of a charm, from the moment of his being usefully employed; and if there
were a happy man in the world, that Saturday night, it was the grateful creature who thought my aunt
the most wonderful woman in existence, and me the most wonderful young man.</p>
<p>“No starving now, Trotwood,” said Mr. Dick, shaking hands with me in a corner. “I'll provide for
her, sir!” and he flourished his ten fingers in the air, as if they were ten banks.</p>
<p>I hardly know which was the better pleased, Traddles or I. “It really,” said Traddles, suddenly,
taking a letter out of his pocket, and giving it to me, “put Mr. Micawber quite out of my head!”</p>
<p>The letter (Mr. Micawber never missed any possible opportunity of writing a letter) was addressed
to me, “By the kindness of T. Traddles, Esquire, of the Inner Temple.” It ran thus:—</p>

<p>“You may possibly not be unprepared to receive the intimation that something has turned up. I may
have mentioned to you on a former occasion that I was in expectation of such an event.</p>
<p>“I am about to establish myself in one of the provincial towns of our favored island, (where the

<p>I was glad to find that Mr. Micawber had got rid of his dust and ashes, and that something really
had turned up at last. Learning from Traddles that the invitation referred to the evening then
wearing away, I expressed my readiness to do honor to it; and we went off together to the lodging
which Mr. Micawber occupied as Mr. Mortimer, and which was situated near the top of the Gray's Inn
Road.</p>
<p>The resources of this lodging were so limited, that we found the twins, now some eight or nine
years old, reposing in a turn-up bedstead in the <pb xml:id="p375"/> family sitting-room, where Mr.
Micawber had prepared, in a wash-handstand jug, what he called “a Brew” of the agreeable beverage
for which he was famous. I had the pleasure, on this occasion, of renewing the acquaintance of
Master Micawber, whom I found a promising boy of about twelve or thirteen, very subject to that
restlessness of limb which is not an unfrequent phenomenon in youths of his age. I also became once
more known to his sister, Miss Micawber, in whom, as Mr. Micawber told us, “her mother renewed her
youth, like the Phoenix.”</p>
<p>“My dear Copperfield,” said Mr. Micawber, “yourself and Mr. Traddles find us on the brink of
migration, and will excuse any little discomforts incidental to that position.”</p>
<p>Glancing round as I made a suitable reply, I observed that the family effects were already
packed, and that the amount of luggage was by no means overwhelming. I congratulated Mrs. Micawber
on the approaching change.</p>
<p>“My dear Mr. Copperfield,” said Mrs. Micawber, “of your friendly interest in all our affairs, I
am well assured. My family may consider it banishment, if they please; but I am a wife and mother,
and I never will desert Mr. Micawber.”</p>
<p>Traddles, appealed to, by Mrs. Micawber's eye, feelingly acquiesced.</p>
<p>“That,” said Mrs. Micawber, “that, at least, is my view, my dear Mr. Copperfield and Mr.
Traddles, of the obligation which I took upon myself when I repeated the irrevocable words, ‘I,
Emma, take thee, Wilkins.’ I read the service over with a flat-candle on the previous night, and the
conclusion I derived from it was, that I never could desert Mr. Micawber. And,” said Mrs. Micawber,
“though it is possible I may be mistaken in my view of the ceremony, I never will!”</p>
<p>“My dear,” said Mr. Micawber, a little impatiently, “I am not conscious that you are expected to
do any thing of the sort.”</p>
<p>“I am aware, my dear Mr. Copperfield,” pursued Mrs. Micawber, “that I am now about to cast my lot
among strangers; and I am also aware that the various members of my family, to whom Mr. Micawber has
written in the most gentlemanly terms, announcing that fact, have not taken the least notice of Mr.
Micawber's communication. Indeed I may be superstitious,” said Mrs. Micawber, “but it appears to me
that Mr. Micawber is destined never to receive any answers whatever to the great majority of the
communications he writes. I may augur, from the silence of my family, that they object to the
resolution I have taken; but I should not allow myself to be swerved from the path of duty, Mr.
Copperfield, even by my papa and mama, were they still living.”</p>
<p>I expressed my opinion that this was going in the right direction.</p>
<p>“It may be a sacrifice,” said Mrs. Micawber, “to immure one's-self in a Cathedral town; but
surely, Mr. Copperfield, if it is a sacrifice in me, it is much more a sacrifice in a man of Mr.
Micawber's abilities.”</p>
<p>“Oh! You are going to a Cathedral town?” said I.</p>
<p>Mr. Micawber, who had been helping us all, out of the wash-handstand jug, replied:</p>
<p>“To Canterbury. In fact, my dear Copperfield, I have entered into arrangements, by virtue of
which I stand pledged and contracted to our friend Heep, to assist and serve him in the capacity
of—and to be—his confidential clerk.”</p>
<pb xml:id="p376"/>
<p>I stared at Mr. Micawber, who greatly enjoyed my surprise.</p>
<p>“I am bound to state to you,” he said, with an official air, “that the business habits, and the
prudent suggestions, of Mrs. Micawber, have in a great measure conduced to this result. The
gauntlet, to which Mrs. Micawber referred upon a former occasion, being thrown down in the form of
an advertisement, was taken up by my friend Heep, and led to a mutual recognition. Of my friend
Heep,” said Mr. Micawber, “who is a man of remarkable shrewdness, I desire to speak with all
possible respect. My friend Heep has not fixed the positive remuneration at too high a figure, but
he has made a great deal, in the way of extrication from the pressure of pecuniary difficulties,
contingent on the value of my services; and on the value of those services I pin my faith. Such
address and intelligence as I chance to possess,” said Mr. Micawber, boastfully disparaging himself,
with the old genteel air, “will be devoted to my friend Heep's service. I have already some
acquaintance with the law—as a defendant on civil process—and I shall immediately apply myself to
the Commentaries of one of the most eminent and remarkable of our English Jurists. I believe it is
unnecessary to add that I allude to Mr. Justice Blackstone.”</p>
<p>These observations, and indeed the greater part of the observations made that evening, were
interrupted by Mrs. Micawber's discovering that Master Micawber was sitting on his boots, or holding
his head on with both arms as if he felt it loose, or accidentally kicking Traddles under the table,
or shuffling his feet over one another, or producing them at distances from himself apparently
outrageous to nature, or lying sideways with his hair among the wine-glasses, or developing his
restlessness of limb in some other form incompatible with the general interests of society; and by
Master Micawber's receiving those discoveries in a resentful spirit. I sat all the while, amazed by
Mr. Micawber's disclosure, and wondering what it meant; until mrs. Micawber resumed the thread of
the discourse, and claimed my attention.</p>
<p>“What I particularly request Mr. Micawber to be careful of, is,” said Mrs. Micawber, “that he
does not, my dear Mr. Copperfield, in applying himself to this subordinate branch of the law, place
it out of his power to rise, ultimately, to the top of the tree. I am convinced that Mr. Micawber,
giving his mind to a profession so adapted to his fertile resources, and his flow of language, <hi
rend="italics">must</hi> distinguish himself. Now, for example, Mr. Traddles,” said Mrs. Micawber,
assuming a profound air, “a Judge, or even say a Chancellor. Does an individual place himself beyond
the pale of those preferments by entering on such an office as Mr. Micawber has accepted?”</p>
<p>“My dear,” observed Mr. Micawber—but glancing inquisitively at Traddles, too; “we have time
enough before us, for the consideration of those questions.”</p>
<p>“Micawber,” she returned, “no! Your mistake in life is, that you do not look forward far enough.
You are bound, in justice to your family, if not to yourself, to take in at a comprehensive glance
the extremest point in the horizon to which your abilities may lead you.</p>
<p>Mr. Micawber coughed, and drank his punch with an air of exceeding satisfaction—still glancing at
Traddles, as if he desired to have his opinion.</p>
<pb xml:id="p377"/>
<p>“Why, the plain state of the case, Mrs. Micawber,” said Traddles, mildly breaking the truth to
her, “I mean the real prosaic fact, you know—”</p>
<p>“Just so,” said Mrs. Micawber, “my dear Mr. Traddles, I wish to be as prosaic and literal as
possible on a subject of so much importance.”</p>
<p>“—Is,” said Traddles, “that this branch of the law, even if Mr. Micawber were a regular
solicitor—”</p>
<p>“Exactly so,” returned Mrs. Micawber. (“Wilkins, you are squinting, and will not be able to get
your eyes back.”)</p>
<p>“—Has nothing,” pursued Traddles, “to do with that. Only a barrister is eligible for such
preferments; and Mr. Micawber could not be a barrister, without being entered at an inn of court as
a student, for five years.”</p>
<p>“Do I follow you?” said Mrs. Micawber, with her most affable air of business. “Do I understand,
my dear Mr. Traddles, that, at the expiration of that period, Mr. Micawber would be eligible as a
Judge or Chancellor?”</p>
<p>“He would be <hi rend="italics">eligible,</hi>” returned Traddles, with a strong emphasis on that
word.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” said Mrs. Micawber. “That is quite sufficient. If such is the case, and Mr. Micawber
forfeits no privilege by entering on these duties, my anxiety is set at rest. I speak,” said Mrs.
Micawber, “as a female, necessarily; but I have always been of opinion that Mr. Micawber possesses
what I have heard my papa call, when I lived at home, the judicial mind; and I hope Mr. Micawber is
now entering on a field where that mind will develope itself, and take a commanding station.”</p>
<p>I quite believe that Mr. Micawber saw himself, in his judicial mind's eye, on the woolsack. He
passed his hand complacently over his bald head, and said with ostentatious resignation:</p>
<p>“My dear, we will not anticipate the decrees of fortune. If I am reserved to wear a wig, I am at
least prepared, externally,” in allusion to his baldness, “for that distinction. I do not,” said Mr.
Micawber, “regret my hair, and I may have been deprived of it for a specific purpose. I cannot say.
It is my intention, my dear Copperfield, to educate my son for the Church; I will not deny that I
should be happy, on his account, to attain to eminence.”</p>
<p>“For the Church?” said I, still pondering, betweenwhiles, on Uriah Heep.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Mr. Micawber. “He has a remarkable head-voice, and will commence as a chorister. Our
residence at Canterbury, and our local connexion, will, no doubt, enable him to take advantage of
any vacancy that may arise in the Cathedral corps.</p>
<p>On looking at Master Micawber again, I saw that he had a certain expression of face, as if his
voice were behind his eyebrows; where it presently appeared to be, on his singing us (as an
alternative between that and bed) “The Wood-Pecker tapping.” After many compliments on this
performance, we fell into some general conversation; and as I was too full of my desperate
intentions to keep my altered circumstances to myself, I made them known to Mr. and Mrs. Micawber. I
cannot express how extremely delighted they both were, by the idea of my aunt's being in
difficulties; and how comfortable and friendly it made them.</p>
<p>When we were nearly come to the last round of the punch, I addressed myself to Traddles, and
reminded him that we must not separate, without <pb xml:id="p378"/> wishing our friends health,
happiness, and success in their new career. I begged Mr. Micawber to fill us bumpers, and proposed
the toast in due form: shaking hands with him across the table, and kissing Mrs. Micawber, to
commemorate that eventful occasion. Traddles imitated me in the first particular, but did not
consider himself a sufficiently old friend to venture on the second.</p>
<p>“My dear Copperfield,” said Mr. Micawber, rising with one of his thumbs in each of his waistcoat
pockets, “the companion of my youth: if I may be allowed the expression—and my esteemed friend
Traddles: if I may be permitted to call him so—will allow me, on the part of Mrs. Micawber, myself,
and our offspring, to thank them in the warmest and most uncompromising terms for their good wishes.
It may be expected that on the eve of a migration which will consign us to a perfectly new
existence,” Mr. Micawber spoke as if they were going five hundred thousand miles, “I should offer a
few valedictory remarks to two such friends as I see before me. But all that I have to say in this
way, I have said. Whatever station in society I may attain, through the medium of the learned
profession of which I am about to become an unworthy member, I shall endeavour not to disgrace, and
Mrs. Micawber will be safe to adorn. Under the temporary pressure of pecuniary liabilities,
contracted with a view to their immediate liquidation, but remaining unliquidated through a
combination of circumstances, I have been under the necessity of assuming a garb from which my
natural instincts recoil—I allude to spectacles—and possessing myself of a cognomen, to which I can
establish no legitimate pretensions. All I have to say on that score is, that the cloud has passed
from the dreary scene, and the God of Day is once more high upon the mountain tops. On Monday next,
on the arrival of the four o'clock afternoon coach at Canterbury, my foot will be on my native
heath—my name, Micawber!”</p>
<p>Mr. Micawber resumed his seat on the close of these remarks, and drank two glasses of punch in
grave succession. He then said with much solemnity:</p>
<p>“One thing more I have to do, before this separation is complete, and that is to perform an act
of justice. My friend Mr. Thomas Traddles has, on two several occasions, ‘put his name,’ if I may
use a common expression, to bills of exchange for my accommodation. On the first occasion Mr. Thomas
Traddles was left—let me say, in short, in the lurch. The <choice
xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">
<sic>fulfilment</sic>
<corr>fulfillment</corr>
</choice> of the second has not yet arrived. The amount of the first obligation,” here Mr. Micawber
carefully referred to papers, “was, I believe, twenty-three, four, nine and a half; of the second,
according to my entry of that transaction, eighteen, six, two. These sums, united, make a total, if
my calculation is correct, amounting to forty-one, ten, eleven and a half. My friend Copperfield
will perhaps do me the favor to check that total?”</p>
<p>I did so and found it correct.</p>
<p>“To leave this metropolis,” said Mr. Micawber, “and my friend Mr. Thomas Traddles, without
acquitting myself of the pecuniary part of this obligation, would weigh upon my mind to an
insupportable extent. I have, therefore, prepared for my friend Mr. Thomas Traddles, and I now hold
in my hand, a document, which accomplishes the desired object. I beg to hand to my friend Mr. Thomas
Traddles my I. O. U. for forty-one, <pb xml:id="p379"/> ten, eleven and a half; and I am happy to
recover my moral dignity, and to know that I can once more walk erect before my fellow man!”</p>
<p>With this introduction (which greatly affected him), Mr. Micawber placed his I. O. U. in the
hands of Traddles, and said he wished him well in every relation of life. I am persuaded, not only
that this was quite the same to Mr. Micawber as paying the money, but that Traddles himself hardly
knew the difference until he had had time to think about it.</p>
<p>Mr. Micawber walked so erect before his fellow man, on the strength of this virtuous action, that
his chest looked half as broad again when he lighted us down stairs. We parted with great heartiness
on both sides; and when I had seen Traddles to his own door, and was going home alone, I thought,
among the other odd and contradictory things I mused upon, that, slippery as Mr. Micawber was, I was
probably indebted to some compassionate recollection he retained of me as his boy-lodger, for never
having been asked by him for money. I certainly should not have had the moral courage to refuse it;
and I have no doubt he knew that (to his credit be it written), quite as well as I did.</p>
</div>
<div type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER XXXVII.
<lb/> A LITTLE COLD WATER.</head>
<p>MY new life had lasted for more than a week, and I was stronger than ever in those tremendous
practical resolutions that I felt the crisis required. I continued to walk extremely fast, and to
have a general idea that I was getting on. I made it a rule to take as much out of myself as I
possibly could, in my way of doing everything to which I applied my energies. I made a perfect
victim of myself. I even entertained some idea of putting myself on a vegetable diet, vaguely
conceiving that, in becoming a graminivorous animal, I should sacrifice to Dora.</p>
<p>As yet, little Dora was quite unconscious of my desperate firmness, otherwise than as my letters
darkly shadowed it forth. But, another Saturday came, and on that Saturday evening she was to be at
Miss Mill's; and when Mr. Mills had gone to his whist-club (telegraphed to me in the street, by a
bird-cage in the drawing-room middle window), I was to go there to tea.</p>
<p>By this time, we were quite settled down in Buckingham Street, where Mr. Dick continued his
copying in a state of absolute felicity. My aunt had obtained a signal victory over Mrs. Crupp, by
paying her off, throwing the first pitcher she planted on the stairs out of window, and protecting
in person, up and down the staircase, a supernumerary whom she engaged from the outer world. These
vigorous measures struck such terror to the breast of Mrs. Crupp, that she subsided into her own
kitchen, under the impression that my aunt was mad. My aunt being supremely indifferent to Mrs.
Crupp's opinion and everybody else's, and rather favoring than discouraging the idea, Mrs. Crupp, of
late the bold, became within a <pb xml:id="p380"/> few days so faint-hearted, that rather than
encounter my aunt upon the staircase, she would endeavour to hide her portly form behind
doors—leaving visible, however, a wide margin of flannel petticoat—or would shrink into dark
corners. This gave my aunt such unspeakable satisfaction, that I believe she took a delight in
prowling up and down, with her bonnet insanely perched on the top of her head, at times when Mrs.
Crupp was likely to be in the way.</p>
<p>My aunt, being uncommonly neat and ingenious, made so many little improvements in our domestic
arrangements, that I seemed to be richer instead of poorer. Among the rest, she converted the pantry
into a dressing-room for me; and purchased and embellished a bedstead for my occupation, which
looked as like a bookcase in the daytime, as a bedstead could. I was the object of her constant
solicitude; and my poor mother herself could not have loved me better, or studied more how to make
me happy.</p>
<p>Peggotty had considered herself highly privileged in being allowed to participate in these
labors; and, although she still retained something of her old sentiment of awe in reference to my
aunt, had received so many marks of encouragement and confidence, that they were the best friends
possible. But the time had now come (I am speaking of the Saturday when I was to take tea at Miss
Mills's) when it was necessary for her to return home, and enter on the discharge of the duties she
had undertaken in behalf of Ham. “So good bye, Barkis,” said my aunt, “and take care of yourself! I
am sure I never thought I could be sorry to lose you!”</p>
<p>I took Peggotty to the coach-office, and saw her off. She cried at parting, and confided her
brother to my friendship as Ham had done. We had heard nothing of him since he went away, that sunny
afternoon.</p>
<p>“And now, my own dear Davy,” said Peggotty, “if, while you're a prentice, you should want any
money to spend; or if, when you're out of your time, my dear, you should want any to set you up (and
you must do one or other, or both, my darling); who has such a good right to ask leave to lend it
you, as my sweet girl's own old stupid me!”</p>
<p>I was not so savagely independent as to say anything in reply, but that if ever I borrowed money
of anyone, I would borrow it of her. Next to accepting a large sum on the spot, I believe this gave
Peggotty more comfort than anything I could have done.</p>
<p>“And, my dear!” whispered Peggotty, “tell the pretty little angel that I should so have liked to
see her, only for a minute! And tell her that before she marries my boy, I'll come and make your
house so beautiful for you, if you'll let me!”</p>
<p>I declared that nobody else should touch it; and this gave Peggotty such delight that she went
away in good spirits.</p>
<p>I fatigued myself as much as I possibly could in the Commons all day, by a variety of devices,
and at the appointed time in the evening repaired to Mr. Mills's street. Mr. Mills, who was a
terrible fellow to fall asleep after dinner, had not yet gone out, and there was no birdcage in the
middle window.</p>
<p>He kept me waiting so long, that I fervently hoped the Club would fine him for being late. At
last he came out; and then I saw my own Dora hang up the birdcage, and peep into the balcony to look
for me, and run in again when she saw I was there, while Jip remained behind, to bark <pb
xml:id="p381"/> injuriously at an immense butcher's dog in the street, who could have taken him like
a pill.</p>
<p>Dora came to the drawing-room door to meet me; and Jip came scrambling out, tumbling over his own
growls, under the impression that I was a Bandit; and we all three went in, as happy and loving as
could be. I soon carried desolation into the bosom of our joys—not that I meant to do it, but that I
was so full of the subject—by asking Dora, without the smallest preparation, if she could love a
beggar?</p>
<p>My pretty, little, startled Dora! Her only association with the word was a yellow face and a
nightcap, or a pair of crutches, or a wooden leg, or a dog with a decanter-stand in his mouth, or
something of that kind; and she stared at me with the most delightful wonder.</p>
<p>“How can you ask me anything so foolish!” pouted Dora. “Love a beggar!”</p>
<p>“Dora, my own dearest!” said I. “<hi rend="italics">I</hi> am a beggar!”</p>
<p>“How can you be such a silly thing,” replied Dora, slapping my hand, “as to sit there, telling
such stories? I'll make Jip bite you!”</p>
<p>Her childish way was the most delicious way in the world to me, but it was necessary to be
explicit, and I solemnly repeated:</p>
<p>“Dora, my own life, I am your ruined David!”</p>
<p>“I declare I'll make Jip bite you!” said Dora, shaking her curls, “if you are so ridiculous.”</p>
<p>But I looked so serious, that Dora left off shaking her curls, and laid her trembling little hand
upon my shoulder, and first looked scared and anxious, then began to cry. That was dreadful. I fell
upon my knees before the sofa, caressing her, and imploring her not to rend my heart; but, for some
time, poor little Dora did nothing but exclaim Oh dear! oh dear! And oh, she was so frightened! And
where was Julia Mills! And oh, take her to Julia Mills, and go away, please! until I was almost
beside myself.</p>
<p>At last, after an agony of supplication and protestation, I got Dora to look at me, with a
horrified expression of face, which I gradually soothed until it was only loving, and her soft,
pretty cheek was lying against mine. Then I told her, with my arms clasped round her, how I loved
her, so dearly, and so dearly; how I felt it right to offer to release her from her engagement,
because now I was poor; how I never could bear it, or recover it, if I lost her; how I had no fears
of poverty, if she had none, my arm being nerved and my heart inspired by her; how I was already
working with a courage such as none but lovers knew; how I had begun to be practical, and to look
into the future; how a crust well earned was sweeter far than a feast inherited; and much more to
the same purpose, which I delivered in a burst of passionate eloquence quite surprising to myself,
though I had been thinking about it, day and night, ever since my aunt had astonished me.</p>
<p>“Is your heart mine still, dear Dora?” said I, rapturously, for I knew by her clinging to me that
it was.</p>
<p>“Oh, yes!” cried Dora. “Oh, yes, it's all yours. Oh, don't be dreadful!”</p>
<p><hi rend="italics">I</hi> dreadful! To Dora!</p>
<p>“Don't talk about being poor, and working hard!” said Dora, nestling closer to me. “Oh, don't,
don't!”</p>
<p>“My dearest love,” said I, “the crust well-earned—”</p>
<pb xml:id="p382"/>
<p>“Oh, yes; but I don't want to hear any more about crusts!” said Dora. “And Jip must have a
mutton-chop every-day at twelve, or he'll die!”</p>
<p>I was charmed with her childish, winning way. I fondly explained to Dora that Jip should have his
mutton-chop with his accustomed regularity. I drew a picture of our frugal home, made independent by
my labor—sketching-in the little house I had seen at Highgate, and my aunt in her room
up-stairs.</p>
<p>“I am not dreadful now, Dora?” said I, tenderly.</p>
<p>“Oh, no, no!” cried Dora. “But I hope your aunt will keep in her own room a good deal! And I hope
she's not a scolding old thing!”</p>
<p>If it were possible for me to love Dora more than ever, I am sure I did. But I felt she was a
little impracticable. It damped my new-born ardor, to find that ardor so difficult of communication
to her. I made another trial. When she was quite herself again, and was curling Jip's ears, as he
lay upon her lap, I became grave, and said:</p>
<p>“My own! May I mention something?”</p>
<p>“Oh, please don't be practical!” said Dora, coaxingly. “Because it frightens me so!”</p>
<p>“Sweet heart!” I returned; “there is nothing to alarm you in all this. I want you to think of it
quite differently. I want to make it nerve you, and inspire you, Dora!”</p>
<p>“Oh, but that's so shocking!” cried Dora.</p>
<p>“My love, no. Perseverance and strength of character will enable us to bear much worse
things.”</p>
<p>“But I haven't got any strength at all,” said Dora, shaking her curls. “Have I, Jip? Oh, do kiss
Jip, and be agreeable!”</p>
<p>It was impossible to resist kissing Jip, when she held him up to me for that purpose, putting her
own bright, rosy little mouth into kissing form, as she directed the operation, which she insisted
should be performed symmetrically, on the centre of his nose. I did as she bade me—rewarding myself
afterwards for my obedience—and she charmed me out of my graver character for I don't know how
long.</p>
<p>“But, Dora, my beloved!” said I, at last resuming it; “I was going to mention something.”</p>
<p>The Judge of the Prerogative Court might have fallen in love with her, to see her fold her little
hands and hold them up, begging and praying me not to be dreadful any more.</p>
<p>“Indeed I am not going to be, my darling!” I assured her. “But, Dora, my love, if you will
sometimes think,—not despondingly, you know; far from that!—but if you will sometimes think—just to
encourage yourself—that you are engaged to a poor man—”</p>
<p>“Don't, don't! Pray don't!” cried Dora. “It's so very dreadful!”</p>
<p>“My soul, not at all!” said I, cheerfully. “If you will sometimes think of that, and look about
now and then at your papa's housekeeping, and endeavour to acquire a little habit—of accounts, for
instance—”</p>
<p>Poor little Dora received this suggestion with something that was half a sob and half a
scream.</p>
<p>“—It will be so useful to us afterwards,” I went on. “And if you would promise me to read a
little—a little Cookery Book that I would send you, it would be so excellent for both of us. For our
path in life, my Dora,” said I, warming with the subject, “is stony and rugged now, <pb
xml:id="p383"/> and it rests with us to smooth it. We must fight our way onward. We must be brave.
There are obstacles to be met, and we must meet, and crush them!”</p>
<p>I was going on at a great rate, with a clenched hand, and a most enthusiastic countenance; but it
was quite unnecessary to proceed. I had said enough. I had done it again. Oh, she was so frightened!
Oh, where was Julia Mills! Oh, take her to Julia Mills, and go away, please! So that, in short, I
was quite distracted, and raved about the drawing-room.</p>
<p>I thought I had killed her, this time. I sprinkled water on her face. I went down on my knees. I
plucked at my hair. I denounced myself as a remorseless brute and a ruthless beast. I implored her
forgiveness. I besought her to look up. I ravaged Miss Mills's work-box for a smelling-bottle, and
in my agony of mind applied an ivory needle-case instead, and dropped all the needles over Dora. I
shook my fists at Jip, who was as frantic as myself. I did every wild extravagance that could be
done, and was a long way beyond the end of my wits when Miss Mills came into the room.</p>
<p>“Who has done this!” exclaimed Miss Mills, succouring her friend.</p>
<p>I replied, “<hi rend="italics">I,</hi> Miss Mills! <hi rend="italics">I</hi> have done it! Behold
the destroyer!”—or words to that effect—and hid my face from the light, in the sofa cushion.</p>
<p>At first Miss Mills thought it was a quarrel, and that we were verging on the Desert of Sahara;
but she soon found out how matters stood, for my dear affectionate little Dora, embracing her, began
exclaiming that I was “a poor laborer;” and then cried for me, and embraced me, and asked me would I
let her give me all her money to keep, and then fell on Miss Mills's neck, sobbing as if her tender
heart were broken.</p>
<p>Miss Mills must have been born to be a blessing to us. She ascertained from me in a few words
what it was all about, comforted Dora, and gradually convinced her that I was not a laborer—from my
manner of stating the case I believe Dora concluded that I was a navigator, and went balancing
myself up and down a plank all day with a wheelbarrow—and so brought us together in peace. When we
were quite composed, and Dora had gone up-stairs to put some rose-water to her eyes, Miss Mills rang
for tea. In the ensuing interval, I told Miss Mills that she was evermore my friend, and that my
heart must cease to vibrate ere I could forget her sympathy.</p>
<p>I then expounded to Miss Mills what I had endeavoured, so very unsuccessfully, to expound to
Dora. Miss Mills replied, on general principles, that the Cottage of content was better than the
Palace of cold splendour, and that where love was, all was.</p>
<p>I said to Miss Mills that this was very true, and who should know it better than I, who loved
Dora with a love that never mortal had experienced yet. But on Miss Mills observing, with
despondency, that it were well indeed for some hearts if this were so, I explained that I begged
leave to restrict the observation to mortals of the masculine gender.</p>
<p>I then put it to Miss Mills, to say whether she considered that there was or was not any
practical merit in the suggestion I had been anxious to make, concerning the accounts, the
housekeeping, and the Cookery Book?</p>
<p>Miss Mills, after some consideration, thus replied:</p>
<p>“Mr. Copperfield, I will be plain with you. Mental suffering and trial <pb xml:id="p384"/>
supply, in some natures, the place of years, and I will be as plain with you as if I were a Lady
Abbess. No. The suggestion is not appropriate to our Dora. Our dearest Dora is a favorite child of
nature. She is a thing of light, and airiness, and joy. I am free to confess that if it could be
done, it might be well, but—” And Miss Mills shook her head.</p>
<p>I was encouraged by this closing admission on the part of Miss Mills to ask her, whether, for
Dora's sake, if she had any opportunity of luring her attention to such preparations for an earnest
life, she would avail herself of it? Miss Mills replied in the affirmative so readily, that I
further asked her if she would take charge of the Cookery Book; and, if she ever could insinuate it
upon Dora's acceptance, without frightening her, undertake to do me that crowning service. Miss
Mills accepted this trust, too; but was not sanguine.</p>
<p>And Dora returned, looking such a lovely little creature, that I really <choice
xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">
<sic>donbted</sic>
<corr>doubted</corr>
</choice> whether she ought to be troubled with anything so ordinary. And she loved me so much, and
was so captivating, (particularly when she made Jip stand on his hind legs for toast, and when she
pretended to hold that nose of his against the hot tea-pot for punishment because he wouldn't), that
I felt like a sort of Monster who had got into a Fairy's bower, when I thought of having frightened
her, and made her cry.</p>
<p>After tea we had the guitar; and Dora sang those same dear old French songs about the
impossibility of ever on any account leaving off dancing, La ra la, La ra la, until I felt a much
greater Monster than before.</p>
<p>We had only one check to our pleasure, and that happened a little while before I took my leave,
when, Miss Mills chancing to make some allusion to to-morrow morning, I unluckily let out that being
obliged to exert myself now, I got up at five o'clock. Whether Dora had any idea that I was a
Private Watchman, I am unable to say; but it made a great impression on her, and she neither played
nor sang any more.</p>
<p>It was still on her mind when I bade her adieu; and she said to me, in her pretty coaxing way—as
if I were a doll, I used to think!</p>
<p>“Now don't get up at five o'clock, you naughty boy. It's so non-sensical!”</p>
<p>“My love,” said I, “I have work to do.”</p>
<p>“But don't do it!” returned Dora. “Why should you?”</p>
<p>It was impossible to say to that sweet little surprised face, otherwise than lightly and
playfully, that we must work, to live.</p>
<p>“Oh! How ridiculous!” cried Dora.</p>
<p>“How shall we live without, Dora?” said I.</p>
<p>“How? Any how!” said Dora.</p>
<p>She seemed to think she had quite settled the question, and gave me such a triumphant little
kiss, direct from her innocent heart, that I would hardly have put her out of conceit with her
answer, for a fortune.</p>
<p>Well! I loved her, and I went on loving her, most absorbingly, entirely, and completely. But
going on, too, working pretty hard, and busily keeping red-hot all the irons I now had in the fire,
I would sit sometimes of a night, opposite my aunt, thinking how I had frightened Dora that time,
and how I could best make my way with a guitar-case through the forest of difficulty, until I used
to fancy that my head was turning quite grey.</p>

<head>PREFACE TO THE CHEAP EDITION OF OLIVER TWIST.</head>
<p>AT page 267 of this present edition of OLIVER TWIST, there is a description of the “filthiest,
the strangest, the most extraordinary, of the many localities that are hidden in London.” And the
name of this place is JACOB'S ISLAND.</p>
<p>Eleven or twelve years have elapsed, since the description was first published. I was as well
convinced then, as I am now, that nothing effectual can be done for the elevation of the poor in
England, until their dwelling-places are made decent and wholesome. I have always been convinced
that this Reform must precede all other Social Reforms; that it must prepare the way for Education,
even for Religion; and that, without it, those classes of the people which increase the fastest,
must become so desperate and be made so miserable, as to bear within themselves the certain seeds of
ruin to the whole community.</p>
<p>The metropolis (of all places under Heaven) being excluded from the provisions of the Public
Health Act, passed last year, a society has been formed called the Metropolitan Sanitary
Association, with the view of remedying this grievous mistake. The association held its first public
meeting at Freemason's Hall, on Wednesday, the sixth of February last: the Bishop of London
presiding. It happened that this very place, JACOB'S ISLAND, had lately attracted the attention of
the Board of Health, in consequence of its having been ravaged by cholera; and that the Bishop of
London had in his hands the result of an inquiry under the Metropolitan Sewers Commission, <choice
xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">
<sic>shewing</sic>
<corr>showing</corr>
</choice>, by way of proof of the cheapness of sanitary improvements, an estimate of the probable
cost at which the houses in JACOB'S ISLAND could be rendered fit for human habitation—which cost was
stated at about a penny three farthings per week per house. The Bishop referred to this paper, with
the moderation and forbearance which pervaded all his observations, and did me the honour to mention
that I had described JACOB'S ISLAND. When I subsequently made a few observations myself, I confessed
that soft impeachment.</p>
<p>Now the vestry of Marylebone parish, meeting on the following Saturday, had the honour to be
addressed by SIR PETER LAURIE; a gentleman of infallible <pb xml:id="p2a"/> authority, of great
innate modesty, and of a most sweet humanity. This remarkable alderman, as I am informed by <hi
rend="italics">The Observer</hi> newspaper, then and there delivered himself (I quote the passage
without any correction) as follows:</p>
<q><p>“Having touched upon the point of saving to the poor, he begged to illustrate it by reading
for them the particulars of a survey that had been made in a locality called ‘Jacob's Island’—[a
laugh]—where, according to the surveyor, 1,300 houses were erected on forty acres of ground. The
surveyor asserted and laid down that each house could be supplied with a constant supply of pure
water—secondly, that each house could be supplied with a sink—thirdly, a water-closet—fourthly, a
drain—fifthly, a foundation drain—and, sixthly, the accommodation of a dust bin [laughter], and all
at the average rate of 13<hi rend="italics">s.</hi> 4<hi rend="italics">d.</hi> per week [oh, oh,
and laughter].</p><p>“Mr. G. BIRD: Can Sir Peter Laurie tell the vestry where ‘Jacob's Island’ is
[laughter].</p><p>“Sir P. LAURIE: That was just what he was about to tell them. The Bishop of
London, poor soul, in his simplicity, thought there really was such a place, which he had been
describing so minutely, <hi rend="italics">whereas it turned out that it</hi> ONLY <hi
rend="italics">existed in a work of fiction, written by Mr. Charles Dickens ten years ago</hi>
[roars of laughter]. <hi rend="italics">The fact was admitted by Mr. Charles Dickens himself at the
meeting,</hi> and he (Sir P. Laurie) had extracted his words from the same paper, the <hi
rend="italics">Morning Herald.</hi> Mr. Dickens said ‘Now the first of these classes proceeded
generally on the supposition that the compulsory improvement of these dwellings, when exceedingly
defective, would be very expensive. But that was a great mistake, for nothing was cheaper than good
sanitary improvements, as they knew in this case of ‘Jacob's Island’ [laughter], which he had
described in a work of fiction some ten or eleven years ago.’ ”</p></q>
<p>When I came to read this, I was so much struck by the honesty, by the truth, and by the wisdom of
this logic, as well as by the fact of the sagacious vestry, including members of parliament,
magistrates, officers, chemists, and I know not who else, listening to it meekly (as became them),
that I resolved to record the fact here, as a certain means of making it known to, and causing it to
be reverenced by, many thousands of people. Reflecting upon this logic, and its universal
application; remembering that when FIELDING described Newgate, the prison immediately ceased to
exist; that when SMOLLETT took Roderick Random to Bath, that city instantly sank into the earth;
that when SCOTT exercised his genius on Whitefriars, it incontinently glided into the Thames; that
an ancient place called Windsor was entirely destroyed in the reign of Queen Elizabeth by two Merry
Wives of that town, acting under the direction of a person of the name of SHAKESPEARE; and that MR.
POPE, after having at a great expense completed his grotto at Twickenham, incautiously reduced it to
ashes by writing a poem upon it;—I say, when I came to consider these things, I was inclined to make
this preface the vehicle of my humble tribute of admiration to SIR PETER LAURIE. But, I am
restrained by a very painful consideration—by no less a consideration than the impossibility of <hi
rend="italics">his</hi> existence. For SIR PETER LAURIE having been himself described in a book (as
I understand he was, one Christmas time, for his conduct on the seat of Justice), it is but too
clear that there CAN be no such man!</p>
<p>Otherwise, I should have been quite sure of his concurrence in the following passage, written
thirty years ago by my late lamented friend the Reverend SYDNEY SMITH, that great master of wit, and
terror of noodles; but singularly applicable to the present occasion.</p>
<p>“We have been thus particular in stating the case, that we may make an answer to those profligate
persons who are always ready to fling an air of ridicule upon the labours of humanity, because they
are desirous that what they have not the virtue to do themselves, should appear to be foolish and
romantic when done by others. A still higher degree of depravity than this, is to want every sort of
compassion for human misery, when it is accompanied by filth, poverty, and ignorance. To regulate
humanity by the income tax, and to deem the bodily wretchedness and the dirty tears of the poor, a
fit subject for pleasantry and contempt. We should have been loth to believe that such deep-seated
and disgusting immorality existed in these days; but the notice of it is forced upon us.”</p>

<head>THE WORKING MAN'S LIBRARY.</head>
<p>IMPORTANT TO THE WORKING CLASSES.</p>
<div>
<opener>It is the intention of JOHN CASSELL to issue</opener>
<head>A LIBRARY
<lb/> EXPRESSLY FOR
<lb/> THE WORKING CLASSES.</head>
<p>It will be completed in <hi rend="italics">Twenty-four Volumes,</hi> one of which will be
published MONTHLY, price <hi rend="italics">Sixpence,</hi> in neat covers. Each volume will contain
<hi rend="italics">one hundred and forty-four pages,</hi> handsomely printed on good paper. The
whole Library, therefore, will only involve an outlay to the Working Man of twelve shillings, in
monthly payments of sixpence; or sixteen shillings for the entire series, bound in cloth, in twelve
volumes.</p>
<p>The object of JOHN CASSELL in issuing this Library, is to furnish the Working Man with a set of
original and instructive works, embracing</p>
<p>HISTORY, BIOGRAPHY, VOYAGES AND TRAVELS,
<lb/> SCIENCE AND ART, PHYSIOLOGY, GEOGRAPHY,
<lb/> &amp;c. &amp;c.;
<lb/> and in order to render them truly valuable, the most able writers in each department will be
employed.</p>
<div>
<opener>The First Volume of</opener>
<head>THE WORKING MAN'S LIBRARY</head>
<p>will be ready by the first of <hi rend="italics">May</hi> next, price 6d.; and the first Double
Volume, price 1s., in a neat cover, or bound in cloth, 1s. 4d., on the first of <hi rend="italics"
>June</hi> next.</p>
<p>JOHN CASSELL trusts that his friends, and the friends of the Working Classes, will make this his
undertaking extensively known, as nothing short of a very large circulation will cover the
outlay.</p>
<p>The first Two Volumes will be entitled
<lb/> SAILINGS OVER THE GLOBE; OR, THE PROGRESS OF MARITIME
<lb/> DISCOVERY: THE EAST, WEST, NORTH, AND SOUTH.</p>
<p>The first Volume, which will appear in May, will contain:—The Rise and Progress of
Navigation—Early Discoveries of the Portuguese—Voyages of Vasco de Gama and Mendez Pinto—the Four
Voyages of Columbus—Cortez and the Discovery of Mexico—Pizarro and the Conquest of Peru.</p>

<head>THE LITERATURE OF WORKING MEN.</head>
<p>Just Published, the First
<lb/> SUPPLEMENTARY NUMBER
<lb/> OF
<lb/> THE WORKING MAN'S FRIEND,
<lb/> TO BE CONTINUED MONTHLY,
<lb/> Uniform in size and price with the Weekly Numbers.</p>
<p>These Supplementary Numbers will be devoted <hi rend="italics">entirely</hi> to communications
from Working Men. An opportunity will thus be afforded to the working classes for furnishing hints
and suggestions as to the improvement of their own order, whether physically, socially, or morally.
In addition, however, to correspondence of this kind, which will always receive respectful
attention, it is the intention of John Cassell, as an encouragement to literary exertion, to award
prizes, in the shape of valuable books, to those whose compositions may be considered worthy of
insertion. No such article ought to exceed about four pages in length. To articles of that extent,
approved by impartial judges, some volume or volumes, to the value of one guinea, selected from a
list by the successful writers, will be forwarded, post free; for shorter articles, volumes varying
in value from five shillings to fifteen shillings will be sent. The numerous communications which
have been received demonstrate, not only that the pages of THE WORKING MAN'S FRIEND are occupied to
the satisfaction of the writers, but also the possession of talent among the working classes of no
ordinary character. Independently of any inducement of the kind now offered, the proposed
Supplementary Numbers could be well filled by the <hi rend="italics">spontaneous</hi> effusions of
men who have not only hard hands, but hard-thinking heads—men who are intensely anxious for the
elevation of their fellows. At the same time it is believed that the presentation of valuable and
instructive works will not only be a suitable acknowledgment to industry and talent, but beneficial
in the influence it will exert in the families and circles of the writers. The trade and initials of
each contributor will be appended. It is to be well understood that the writers must belong strictly
to the operative class. The subjects may embrace morality, social order and comfort, history,
biography, art, science, general literature, and the principles and claims of any movement tending
to promote the improvement and welfare of the people.</p>
<p>All communications to be addressed to JOHN CASSELL, 335, Strand, London. Full address in each
case.</p>

<div>
<head>THE FOLLOWING ARE SOME OF THE
<lb/> OPINIONS OF THE PUBLIC PRESS:</head>
<p>(From the <hi rend="italics">Daily News.</hi>)</p>
<p>A cheap, useful, and amusing miscellany.</p>
<p>(From the <hi rend="italics">Atlas.</hi>)</p>
<p>A cheap weekly serial, devoted to the improvement and amusement of the working classes. We see
little that is objectionable in this periodical, and very much to commend. It is pleasantly and
thoughtfully written. It is likely, we think, to do good service in a good cause.</p>
<p>(From the <hi rend="italics">London Patriot.</hi>)</p>
<p>Several articles in the first two numbers (all that are as yet issued) are of a first-rate
character, and would do no dishonour to our best magazines; while they are skilfully adapted, in
tone and treatment, to the class of readers contemplated. Most of the writers are anonymous; but
Mary Howitt, who contributes some characteristic stories, is not, we venture to say, the only author
of celebrity engaged on this new miscellany.</p>
<p>(From the <hi rend="italics">Nonconformist,</hi> January 9.)</p>
<p>If the enterprise is sustained with as much spirit as it has been commenced, its success cannot
be doubted. This first number forms an excellent pennyworth of instruction and entertainment, free
from all that is injurious or debasing.</p>
<p>(From the <hi rend="italics">Manchester Examiner and Times.</hi>)</p>
<p>A new weekly periodical of excellent quality and amazing bulk for a penny. The well-known
energies and extensive appliances of its publisher are guaranteed for continued excellence and
success. Among the many excellent journals useful to the working man, this must stand in the first
class. It takes that place at its first step; and if instructive to those to whom it is specially
addressed, it cannot fail to be so to those who occupy a higher social position.</p>
<p>(From the <hi rend="italics">Dumfries and Galloway Standard.</hi>)</p>
<p>THE WORKING MAN'S FRIEND AND FAMILY INSTRUCTOR. Such is the title of Mr. Cassell's new magazine,
and it does him infinite credit. The topics discussed are various, all ably and popularly treated.
It promises to be one of the best, and we are inclined to rank it as the cheapest in the whole range
of our serial literature.</p>
<p>(From the <hi rend="italics">Scottish Reformer's Gazette.</hi>)</p>
<p>We think we may express our unqualified approbation of the sound and healthful spirit which
animates THE WORKING MAN'S FRIEND. It contains an amazing quantity of interesting, instructive, and
well-selected matter, and deserves to be universally read by that extensive class for whom it is
especially intended.</p>
<p>(From the <hi rend="italics">Newcastle Guardian.</hi>)</p>
<p>Such a variety of clever and instructive writing has never been previously offered to the public.
For cheapness and real excellence there is nothing to equal this periodical, even in these days of
amplified publishing.</p>
<p>(From the <hi rend="italics">Glasgow Examiner.</hi>)</p>
<p>The working classes will not be their own friends if they do not largely patronise this very
suitable publication. The publisher is doing his duty, and we shall be disappointed if the working
classes neglect theirs.</p>
<p>(From the <hi rend="italics">Leicester Mercury.</hi>)</p>
<p>THE WORKING MAN'S FRIEND is really one of the cheapest periodicals of the day and the papers are
generally written with great care and force.</p>
<p>(From the <hi rend="italics">Edinburgh News.</hi>)</p>
<p>This is a clever and business-like production. Its aim is of a more practical character than the
majority of the cheap publications. It seems to strive mainly at imparting useful information in
matters of political, social, and domestic economy; and if we may be entitled to speak from the
specimen before us, it may be safely averred that the projector has been completely successful.</p>
<pb xml:id="p6a"/>
<p>(From the <hi rend="italics">Nottingham Review.</hi>)</p>
<p>The first monthly part has made its appearance, and fully bears out its title as a “friend” and
“instructor,” and is moreover extremely talented and interesting.</p>
<p>(From the <hi rend="italics">Plymouth Journal.</hi>)</p>
<p>We have seen a great deal of cheap literature of late, and its appearance has excited our
astonishment; but we have seen nothing equal to the pennyworth that is now before us. It is not only
literary, but has a very large spice of that political information, which will render it essentially
welcome to working men, most of whom hold decided views, and are friendly to those works that give
utterance to them.</p>
<p>(From the <hi rend="italics">North and South Shields Gazette.</hi>)</p>
<p>Without hyperbole or humbug, this is the rarest Working Man's Friend we have met with for many a
day. We say to all our readers—and especially to such as have families—go and get a copy of it the
first opportunity, and then if most of you do not become regular subscribers, for your own sake, or
for that of the young folks, we shall think our taste is defective.</p>
<p>(From the <hi rend="italics">Norfolk News.</hi>)</p>
<p>We hail with pleasure every effort to enlighten the minds of <hi rend="italics">the people,</hi>
relative to their rights and their duties, as members of social and political society; but we give
more than ordinary welcome to this little serial, inasmuch as it is more adapted to the requirements
of the day than any other of the class which we have yet seen. It is cheap, interesting, and
instructive. The opening <choice xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">
<sic>addressess</sic>
<corr>addresses</corr>
</choice> alone are worth more than ten times the cost of the whole. To every working man, ay, and
to every man, we say: “Take it regularly, read it regularly with an unprejudiced mind, and you will,
if the first and second numbers be a guarantee of its future career, be as regularly gratified with
its matter, and the spirit in which it is conducted.”</p>
<p>(From the <hi rend="italics">Bath Journal.</hi>)</p>
<p>Thirty-two pages of very close print, most of it original literature, of a very superior sort,
and the remainder selected with very great care and excellent judgment, all for one penny. Nothing
but an extraordinarily large circulation can repay the enterprising publisher and proprietor. Here
is food wholesome and strengthening, for a man's mind, supplied at a cost trifling enough to be
wonderful, and compared with which the price of bread of life is monstrously high.</p>
<p>(From the <hi rend="italics">Darlington Times.</hi>)</p>
<p>This is the first number of one of the cheapest periodicals which this age of cheap literature
has produced, and, moreover, one of the best. Mr. Cassell has long appeared in the van of many of
the progressive movements of the day; but we question if either of the great movements in which he
has been engaged is more calculated to advance the interests of the working classes than the
publication of this little weekly. We have for a mere nominal price thirty-two closely-printed
octavo pages of sterling matter, embracing the greatest possible variety of subjects, all of which
blend interest and entertainment with solid instruction and sound information.</p>
<p>(From the <hi rend="italics">Bristol Mercury.</hi>)</p>
<p>We can safely say that in the variety and literary merits of its contents, and its extreme
cheapness, it is one of the most remarkable publications of the class which have come under our
notice. If such a publication as this do not successfully appeal to the working man, nothing of the
sort can do so.</p>
<p>(From the <hi rend="italics">Liverpool Albion.</hi>)</p>
<p>The cheapness of this publication, and the high morality inculcated throughout its articles,
cannot fail to elevate the minds of its readers.</p>
<p>(From the <hi rend="italics">Liverpool Mercury.</hi>)</p>
<p>This is a surprising pamphlet. Every man and woman ought to order one copy, at all events, from a
bookseller, and take it in as long as they find it worth the money to them and their firesides. It
will be found worth much more, and will save money beside.</p>
<p>(From the <hi rend="italics">Edinburgh Register.</hi>)</p>
<p>The Editor thoroughly understands his business, and has produced a periodical in every respect
adapted for the fireside of the working man. Its lightness and liveliness are excellent
characteristics, and will be great recommendations to men coming home of an evening from a hard
day's work.</p>
<p>(From the <hi rend="italics">West Briten.</hi>)</p>
<p>A new periodical of extreme cheapness, published weekly and in monthly parts, and well
calculated, by the amount of substantial information it contains, to diffuse knowledge among the
working classes.</p>

<head>EXHIBITION
<lb/> OF
<lb/> INDUSTRY OF ALL NATIONS;
<lb/> TO BE HELD IN LONDON IN 1851.</head>
<div>
<p>HER MAJESTY'S COMMISSIONERS for the Promotion of the EXHIBITION OF THE WORKS OF INDUSTRY OF ALL
NATIONS, to be holden in 1851, having had the various subjects of their inquiry under their anxious
consideration, are now prepared to state, for the information of the public, the progress they have
made in determining on the different points referred to in their announcement of the 11th January
last.</p>
<p>The decisions they have been able to come to have been necessarily limited by their present want
of knowledge as to what pecuniary means will be placed at their disposal; and the shortness of the
time, during which this vast organization will have to be completed renders it imperative upon the
Commissioners to make an earnest appeal to the country, to enable them as soon as possible, to know
upon what amount of subscriptions they may ultimately rely.</p>
<p>The scale upon which this important undertaking will be conducted, must depend entirely on the
amount of pecuniary support which it shall receive from the public. Her Majesty's Commissioners
appeal with confidence to all classes of the community, to enable them to make such liberal
arrangements as will ensure the success of this undertaking, in a manner worthy of the character and
position of this country, and of the invitation which has been given to the other nations of the
world to compete with us in a spirit of generous and friendly emulation.</p>
<p>The Commissioners have fixed upon the 1st day of May, 1851, for opening the Exhibition.</p>
<p>The Commissioners will be prepared to receive and take care of, at the expense of the
Commissioners, all articles which may be sent to them, and delivered at a place to be named by the
Commissioners in London, on or after the 1st of January, 1851, and will continue so to receive goods
until the 1st of March inclusive; after which day no further goods will be received.</p>
<p>Her Majesty has been graciously pleased to grant a site for this purpose on the south side of
Hyde Park, lying between the Kensington Drive and the Ride commonly called Rotten Row.</p>
<p>From the approximate estimate which the Commissioners have been able to make, they believe that
the Building ought to cover a space of from 16 to 20 Acres, or about One million of Square Feet.</p>
<p>The Productions of all Nations will be exhibited together, under one General Classification.</p>
<p>The Articles exhibited will be divided into Four Sections, as before announced, and a Classified
List, together with general instructions affecting each Department, are appended. Her Majesty's
Commissioners with to express their grateful sense of the valuable assistance which they have
received in drawing up that List from the Members of the Sectional Committees.</p>
<p>The Building will be provided to the Exhibitors free from rent, and will be fire-proof.</p>
<p>Exhibitors will be required to deliver their objects, at their own charge and risk, at the
Building in the Park; but no charges of any kind will be made whilst they remain there.</p>
<p>Colonial and Foreign productions will be admitted without paying duty, for the purposes of
exhibition, but not for internal consumption. Her Majesty's Commissioners of Customs will consider
all such Articles as Bonded Goods; and Her Majesty's Commissioners for the Exhibition of 1851 will
make suitable arrangements for their reception.</p>
<p>Her Majesty's Commissioners are desirous that there should be complete local organization, and
that the Local Committees, wherever formed, should themselves collect the Subscriptions within their
own districts. The Local Committees should advertise all Subscriptions they receive, and defray all
local expenses, paying such commission for collection as they may think necessary.</p>
<p>Her Majesty's Commissioners think that the same complete system of organization should be
extended as much as possible to the British Colonies.</p>
<p>Subscriptions should be paid to the Treasurers of Local Committees, and by them transferred to
the General Fund at the Bank of England, in the names of A. K. Barclay, Esq., W. Cotton, Esq., Sir
J. W. Lubbock, Bart., S. M. Peto, Esq., M.P., and Baron Lionel de Rothschild, M.P.</p>
<p>Her Majesty's Commissioners having undertaken the absolute control over the expenditure of all
money that may come into the hands of their Treasurers, have made arrangements for auditing
accounts, and ensuring the strictest economy.</p>
<pb xml:id="p2b"/>
<p>Her Majesty's Commissioners hope that the funds to be placed at their disposal by voluntary
contributions may be such as to enable them so to regulate the amount to be paid for entrance, that
all classes may be enabled to visit the Exhibition.</p>
<p>Should any surplus remain, after giving every facility to the Exhibitors and increasing the
privileges of the Public as spectators, Her Majesty's Commissioners intend to apply the same to
purposes strictly in connexion with the ends of the Exhibition, or for the establishment of similar
Exhibitions for the future.</p>
<p>However large the Building may be,—the quantity of articles sent for Exhibition may exceed any
amount of space that can be provided;—Her Majesty's Commissioners consequently reserve to themselves
ample powers of rejection and selection. Upon the amount subscribed must necessarily depend the
space which they may be enabled to allot; but under all circumstances they will have to exercise a
certain discretion.</p>
<p>Her Majesty's Commissioners also desire that the Local Committees will, as early as possible,
procure an inventory or general specification of articles proposed to be exhibited from their
Districts, and of the space which will be required for their exhibition, in order to enable the
Commissioners to determine as soon as possible the extent and the proportions of the building.</p>
<p>Her Majesty's Commissioners are in communication with the Foreign Office, concerning the means of
informing Foreign Governments of the arrangements making for the Exhibition.</p>
<p>Her Majesty's Commissioners are considering the principles upon which the Prize Fund of £20,000,
shall be appropriated, and the best mode of adjudication.</p>
<p>If there be any points upon which Local Committees may require information, and will address
themselves to the Secretaries of the Commission, Her Majesty's Commissioners will be happy to afford
it to them, so far as it may be in their power.</p>

<head>Section 1.—Raw Materials and Produce.</head>
<div type="section">
<head>Division (A).—Mineral Kingdom.</head>
<p>It is desirable that the Raw Materials should be shown in connection with the produce of the
Mineral Kingdom, so as to form a history and explanation of the processes employed to fit them for
the useful and ornamental purposes of life. The Exhibition would thus comprehend (1.) Illustrations
of the various modes of extracting and preparing the <hi rend="italics">Raw Materials</hi> for
Produce; (2.) Illustrations of methods of reducing, working, or combining Raw Materials, so as to
obtain <hi rend="italics">Products</hi> which may afterwards receive applications to the useful or
ornamental purposes of life.</p>
<p>The Specimens fitted for exhibition should include (1.) only those remarkable for their <hi
rend="italics">excellence,</hi> for <hi rend="italics">novelty</hi> in their occurrence or
application, or <hi rend="italics">economy</hi> of their extraction or preparation; or (2.) those
remarkable as <hi rend="italics">illustrations</hi> of some further processes of Manufacture.</p>
</div>
<div type="section">
<pb xml:id="p7a"/>
<head>Division (B.)—Vegetable Kingdom.</head>
<p>The objects which the Commission is most desirous of receiving, among the products of the
Vegetable Kingdom, are such as from their utility, novelty, or practical interest may appear
especially deserving public attention. Peculiarly fine samples of substances in common use;
authenticated samples of substances having similar properties, but derived from different
sources—such as Arrowroot, Sago, &amp;c. Dyeing Materials, accompanied by specimens exhibiting the
effect of such Materials. Fancy Wood, both in the polished, rough, and manufactured state. All sorts
of materials, which are applicable to the manufacture of linen, cordage, wicker work, paper, and the
like.</p>
<p>Nothing, however, appears suitable to this Exhibition except such results of human industry as
are capable of being preserved without injury through several months.</p>
</div>
<div type="section">
<head>Division (C.)—Animal Kingdom.</head>
<p>As Illustrations in this Division, the various Processes of Preparation may be exhibited in
connection with the Raw Materials; and in some cases a Finished Article may be introduced as the
termination of a series of objects in preparatory stages.</p>
<p>Nothing, however, appears suitable to this Exhibition except such results of human industry as

</div>
</div>
<div type="section">
<head>Section 2.—Machinery.</head>
<div type="section">
<head>Division (A.)—Machines for Direct Use.</head>
<p>Machines will be exhibited in motion, whenever it may be desirable to do so, and it may be found
practicable to provide the necessary arrangements for that purpose.</p>
</div>
<div type="section">
<head>Division (B.)—Manufacturing Machines.</head>
<p>Although in arranging this class for exhibition, it will generally be found advisable to separate
the Products from the Producing Mechanism; yet the latter should always be accompanied with
sufficient specimens of the Raw Material, in its several stages of manufacture, and of the finished
product, to make the operation of the Machinery intelligible.</p>
<p>The complete series of tools and machinery that belongs to the manufacture of any object of
common use, such as a watch, a button, or a needle, accompanied by specimens of the object and its
parts, in their various stages of progress, is so instructive and interesting, that it is very
desirable to obtain several such series for the proposed Exhibition.</p>

<head>ON AN OLD PICTURE</head>
<lg type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
<l part="N">How that old picture brings before the eye</l>
<l part="N">The Dress peculiar to the days gone by!</l>
<l part="N">Look at the figures! such outlandish styles</l>
<l part="N">Seem fashion'd only to provoke to smiles.</l>
<l part="N">How very diff'rent were the dresses worn</l>
<l part="N">When that old fashion'd picture first was drawn.</l>
<l part="N">See! <hi rend="italics">there's</hi> a curious coat—and <hi rend="italics">there's</hi>
a hat!</l>
<l part="N">And <hi rend="italics">there's</hi> a bonnie waistcoat! look at that!</l>
<l part="N">What would be thought, if, in the <hi rend="italics">present</hi> day,</l>
<l part="N">A person were to dress in such a way?</l>
<l part="N">Folks in the public streets would stand to mock</l>
<l part="N">And make th' eccentric man a laughing stock.</l>
<l part="N">Though all the fashion, fifty years ago.</l>
<l part="N">They would not now pass muster—O, dear, no!</l>
<l part="N">MOSES and SON's superior style in clothes</l>
<l part="N">Would ne'er be set aside for such as those.</l>
<l part="N">You see by that old picture, hanging there,</l>
<l part="N">What vast improvements have been brought to bear.</l>
<l part="N">Look at that coat! how wretchedly it fits,</l>
<l part="N">And see the vest! how awkwardly it sits.</l>
<l part="N">Mine (which I bought of MOSES, by the bye),</l>
<l part="N">In style and fit, offend not thus the eye.</l>
<l part="N">MOSES and SON for me! no Tailors please</l>
<l part="N">In any single sense, compared with these.</l>
<l part="N">Their Boots and Hats, as well as their attire,</l>
<l part="N">Are positively all that we require.</l>
<l part="N">Better I never saw, nor better want,</l>
<l part="N">And better can't be had, depend upon't.</l>
<l part="N">MOSES and SON for me! no tradesmen please,</l>
<l part="N">In any single point, compared with these.</l>
